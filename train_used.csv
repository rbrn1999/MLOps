Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,Partner with communities to advance food security and make nutritious food accessible to 50 million people.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,We expect to achieve this goal through a combination of both philanthropic and commercial initiatives.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"In order for commercial products to count towards the goal, they must."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Meet our internal Global Nutrition Criteria for Affordable Nutrition Initiatives, which includes maximum thresholds for nutrients to limit (added sugars, sodium, saturated fatty acids, and trans fat); minimum micronutrient levels to help combat hidden hunger; and food groups and nutrients to encourage such as whole grains and fiber."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Be accessible to lower-income consumers at risk for undernutrition, as determined at the market level and informed by local socioeconomic indicators and externally available data."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"For example, Quaker 3 Minutos provides lower-income consumers in Mexico value for their money without having to compromise on nutrition."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Offered at an affordable price point, the product is fortified with vitamins and minerals including shortfall nutrients in the country."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,PepsiCo is continuously renovating and expanding its portfolio to provide consumers with products that provide nutritional benefits.

Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,The 2021 launch of our PepsiCo Positive ambition marks an important milestone on this journey to offer consumers Positive Choices in nutrition.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Over the years, we have enhanced our portfolio through a combination of reformulation, new product innovations and the acquisition of new brands:"
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Through reformulations, we improve the nutritional profile of many of our products by reducing added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Through acquisitions, we have added a number of the world's most trusted and loved positive nutrition brands to our business."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,We believe that we have an opportunity to positively influence the diets of people around the world through the delivery of great tasting products that also deliver important nutrients and food groups.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"With a global rise in urban living and ""on-the-go"" eating habits, consumers are demanding products that are at once nutritious, convenient, great tasting, and are trusted from quality and food safety perspectives."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,Developing and delivering products that deliver these attributes is a priority for PepsiCo.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"To help provide nutrition guidance during the development of our beverages and foods, and diversify our product portfolio in the process, we deploy the PepsiCo Nutrition Criteria (PNC)."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,The PNC set standards for nutrients to limit as well as nutrients and food groups to encourage that are based on the latest science and country specific dietary guidelines.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Nutrients to Limit are nutrients that have been well-established as dietary factors that can contribute to the risk of certain non-communicable diseases, when consumed in excess."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"They include: saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, and added sugars."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,Nutrients to Encourage are nutrients that have been identified as being commonly under-consumed in the population.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"They are sometimes called ""shortfall nutrients."""
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"They typically include: fiber, specific vitamins and/or minerals such as iron, vitamin A and calcium."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,Food Groups to Encourage are food groups that have been well-established as contributing to well-balanced diets.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"They include: fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, among others."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"These standards are used by our product development teams both to reformulate existing products by improving their nutritional profile, and to guide the development of new product innovation."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"To apply the PNC in a relevant way to our portfolio, we have a tiered set of specific criteria for 20 food and beverage categories."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,Products are evaluated based on their nutrient profile as well as how they are consumed within the diet to determine which criteria should apply.
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"With consumers around the world moving toward more nutritious options, we believe that our portfolio of nutritious options is vital to the strength of our business."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"Our portfolio includes products with food groups like grains, fruits and vegetables and those that deliver fiber and/or protein, plus those that are complementary, like water and unsweetened tea, which support hydration without adding calories or nutrients to limit."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"In markets all over the world, we work to create products that are suited to local needs in terms of both taste and nutrition, with brands that consumers trust."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"For example, our 2020 acquisition of Pioneer Foods brought together two like-minded companies focused on building a more sustainable future and investing in communities."
Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,The PepsiCo Foundation is another vehicle for providing nutritious food to the underserved.

Opportunities in Nutrition and Health,"As part of this effort, the company and our partners distributed more than 145 million nutritious meals to at-risk populations."

Privacy and Data Security,Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief.
Privacy and Data Security,We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously.
Privacy and Data Security,"Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters."

Electronic Waste,But our commitment goes beyond legislation.
Electronic Waste,"For example, we currently have take-back programs in place in each region around the world."
Electronic Waste,"Our recycling website includes more information about how to recycle Motorola Solutions equipment, batteries and all other products."
Electronic Waste,We fully comply with the EU Battery Directive.
Electronic Waste,We also voluntarily publish product data sheets that help our customers manage our three main types of batteries:
Electronic Waste,"The major renovation of the second floor of SaskTel's building located at 140 1st Avenue North in Saskatoon involved the renovation of approximately 1,500 m2 of office space as well as showers, washrooms, a lounge, and a fitness centre."
Electronic Waste,This project achieved a certification level of Silver in November 2014 for LEED Canada for Commercial Interiors 1.0 (LEED CI 1.0) and is SaskTel's first certified green building.
Electronic Waste,The project is the first project in Saskatchewan to be certified under LEED CI 1.0.
Electronic Waste,"To align with the Government's Producer Responsibility Scheme for WEEE, PCCW provides removal services for our customers whenever they purchase regulated electrical equipment."
Electronic Waste,The collected waste equipment is sent to certified recyclers for proper treatment to achieve resource recovery.
Electronic Waste,"In 2021, we helped customers remove more than 2,500 pieces of WEEE."
Electronic Waste,"By introducing in our retail shops a trade-in and preliminary valuation service, we also encourage customers to reduce waste generation and promote a circular economy when they replace their mobile devices."
Electronic Waste,"In 2021, we collected and recycled over 5,500 old mobile handsets and accessories from customers for donation to Caritas Computer Workshops."
Electronic Waste,The materials and components used to construct our products account for a large portion of the total emissions footprint associated with our business.
Electronic Waste,"Our strategy is to identify and incorporate better materials that deliver the functionality we're looking for, with lower impact."
Electronic Waste,We're starting with procuring higher levels of recycled content in the materials we already purchase but are also exploring new material options.
Electronic Waste,"Through this environmental performance lens and lifecycle assessments, we look to make both incremental and stepchange differences in each new generation of tools and solutions for the makers of the world."
Electronic Waste,"To ensure responsible battery metals sourcing, Stanley Black & Decker conducted a deep dive of our battery supply chain in 2021."
Electronic Waste,"We contracted leading responsible sourcing firm RCS Global to map and audit our battery supply chain, from mine to battery"
Electronic Waste,"The project determined the material flow of cobalt, lithium, graphite, manganese and nickel inputs into our batteries and assessed suppliers against responsible sourcing criteria to identify and mitigate human rights risks along the supply chain."
Electronic Waste,The work was carried out in accordance with the World Economic Forum Global Battery Alliance on transparent supply chains and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance on Responsible Sourcing principles.
Electronic Waste,We collaborated with three of our battery suppliers and worked with RCS Global to conduct 36 audits.
Electronic Waste,"The results showed no critical risks related to child labor, occupational health and safety or environment."
Electronic Waste,To help our product development teams better understand the impacts of their material selections we worked with Anthesis to develop an Excelbased Life Cycle Assessment Screening tool.
Electronic Waste,Electrification and cordless power have become a focus for us as both the market adoption of and demand for these products are accelerating.
Electronic Waste,"In Power Tools, Outdoor Power Equipment and Engineered Fastening, the benefits today and in the future of further electrification are significant."
Electronic Waste,"In outdoor power equipment, battery-operated products are safer, deliver significantly lower emissions and are much quieter versus their gasoline-powered counterparts."
Electronic Waste,Our acquisitions of MTD and Excel create the ideal combination to electrify this $25 billion and growing market.
Electronic Waste,"Our brands, channels and capabilities in battery technology, combined with acquired prowess in outdoor equipment manufacturing and product innovation, set us up nicely to capture this disruptive opportunity."
Electronic Waste,"In the coming years, one can expect a remarkable wave of emission reduction innovation in Tools & Outdoor industry electrification, led by Stanley Black & Decker."
Electronic Waste,The benefits of electrification also extends to our Stanley Engineered Fastening business.
Electronic Waste,"In the automotive world, the transition to plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle (EV) platforms represents a 3-to-6x dollar content per vehicle opportunity versus traditional combustion-powered vehicles."
Electronic Waste,"We expect that the market inflection point will occur in or around 2026, when we believe global production of EVs and hybrids will likely exceed combustion-powered autos."
Electronic Waste,"And as this shift occurs, approximately 27 million of these vehicles are likely to be produced annually; the future annualized potential for our business is measured in the billion dollar range."
Electronic Waste,"This is a compelling business opportunity, but more importantly the impact on the environment of helping to replace internal combustion engines on the roads of the world cannot be overstated."
Electronic Waste,Our revolutionary FLEXVOLT battery continues to reshape the Power Tools marketplace in our favor.
Electronic Waste,But our cordless tools innovation doesn't stop there.
Electronic Waste,"New in 2021, POWERSTACKTM brings breakthrough pouch battery cell technology to the jobsite."

Electronic Waste,"We can further extend the lifetime of our products by refurbishing systems after they have been used in the most advanced chipmaking factories, repurposing them for other customers and semiconductor environments."
Electronic Waste,"As a result of our approach, nearly 94% of the lithography systems we've ever sold across our whole portfolio, are still in use at customer sites, highlighting our ability to contribute to a circular economy."
Electronic Waste,"Within our operations, the main waste streams are:"
Electronic Waste,"Non-hazardous waste, such as packaging material, product-related waste from parts resulting from upgrades or defects, and general waste. This category also includes construction waste, which results from building activities."
Electronic Waste,"Hazardous waste, for example the chemicals we use in our manufacturing processes"
Electronic Waste,We have set ourselves two targets to reduce our waste footprint. The first target is to reduce our waste intensity - the amount of waste generated in kg per € million revenue - by 50% in 2025 compared to baseline year 2019.
Electronic Waste,The second target is to increase our material recycling to 85% by 2025.
Electronic Waste,These targets include hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
Electronic Waste,"To achieve these targets, we are focusing on circular procurement, driving awareness across our company, implementing (process) efficiency and improvement projects and supporting employee initiatives."
Electronic Waste,"We prioritize solutions to reduce, re- use and recycle our waste as much as possible, rather than sending it to an incineration plant or landfill."
Electronic Waste,Managing waste from our operations is a complex issue and relies on having detailed and accurate insight into waste streams to and from ASML.
Electronic Waste,"We manage our waste through proper classification, separation and safe disposal. Although we've developed procedures to monitor and measure waste that leaves our premises, it's much harder to gain insight on the waste streams of our customers."
Electronic Waste,"In 2021, we generated 5,878 tonnes of waste from the activities on our sites and 77% of this was recycled (from 85% in 2020)."
Electronic Waste,"Compared to 2020, the total amount of waste increased by nearly 12% (from 5,257 tonnes), mainly due to both the increase of our reporting scope from 20 locations in 2020 to 57 locations in 2021 and the growth of the company."
Electronic Waste,"Waste reduction programs for the expanded scope need to be defined and implemented, aiming at 2022."
Electronic Waste,"Non-hazardous waste accounted for 93% (5,483 tonnes) of our total waste in 2021, of which the vast majority was diverted through recycling."
Electronic Waste,"We reduced non-hazardous waste through several ongoing programs, such as:"
Electronic Waste,"Circular IT life cycle: After four years of use, we give all functioning computers and laptops a second life. In the case of defective computers, we recycle clean, separated streams of recycled plastic, iron, steel, copper, aluminum, glass and precious metals. This has led to over 30,000 kg of materials recycled, which is a sharp increase of 25% compared to 24,000 kg recycled in 2020."
Electronic Waste,"Flexible cleanrooms: These are cleanrooms that can be moved between locations and assembled quickly, while providing the same standards and performance as our current fixed cleanrooms. More than 95% of the materials used in the flexible cleanroom set-up are re-usable with a lifespan of more than 30 years."
Electronic Waste,In 2021 we used the flexible cleanroom concept for five service warehouses.
Electronic Waste,"Other examples are local waste reduction initiatives initiated by our employees, such as plastic recycling and working with re-usable gloves in cleanrooms."
Electronic Waste,"Construction waste: As we expand our operations, we try to make sure that waste from construction activities are recycled wherever we can. Construction waste accounted for 3% (199 tonnes) of our total waste generated in 2021 (compared to 4% in 2020), of which 85% was recycled."
Electronic Waste,"In 2021, we added three work centers and one logistics warehouse to our Veldhoven campus."
Electronic Waste,In our real-estate portfolio management we apply BREEAM standards which emphasize sustainability through the circular use of materials.
Electronic Waste,"For example, almost all of the material from a demolished sprinkler basin was re-used in our new buildings and we recycled 'old' cleanroom suits into acoustic wall panels for our meeting rooms."
Electronic Waste,"To produce and operate our products and systems, we need to make use of hazardous substances. In 2021, hazardous waste accounted for nearly 7% (395 tonnes) of our total waste generated."
Electronic Waste,"Of this, nearly 88% was recycled. Hazardous waste can include lamps, batteries, hazardous liquids, empty packaging from hazardous materials, and cleaning wipes and filters."
Electronic Waste,"Liquids, including acetone and sulfuric acid, are the majority of our hazardous waste streams."
Electronic Waste,The use of hazardous substances makes us subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to environmental protection (as well as employee and product health and safety).
Electronic Waste,"These include transport, use, storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, and disposal of hazardous substances."
Electronic Waste,Minimizing waste and maximizing resources to extract the maximum value from the materials we use and repurpose our products across their life cycles.
Electronic Waste,We are committed to a circular economy and ensuring that any materials we use retain and generate as much value as possible for us and for our partners in the ecosystem.
Electronic Waste,"To minimize waste and maximize resources, we focus on three core strategies"
Electronic Waste,Reduce waste in our operations
Electronic Waste,Re-use parts and materials from the installed base
Electronic Waste,Recycle mature products through refurbishment
Electronic Waste,The cornerstone of our circular approach is the modular design of our products. It enables us to upgrade a system to a higher performance level at a customer site rather than having to replace the entire product.
Electronic Waste,A well-maintained ASML lithography system can last for decades and can be used by more than one fab.
Electronic Waste,"Many ASML lithography systems start out in cutting-edge fabs - once that fab needs to upgrade, the lithography systems are given a new lease of life in a fab where the manufacturer requires comparatively less sophisticated chips, such as accelerometers or radio frequency chips."
Electronic Waste,"Our Mature Products and Services (MPS) business focuses on the refurbishment of the following product families: the PAS 5500 (with around 1,800 systems at customer sites worldwide), the TWINSCAN XT systems, and, as of 2021, the NXT:1950-1980 systems."
Electronic Waste,"Our refurbishment strategy focuses on buying back systems that are not operational in the field, harvesting parts from decommissioned systems, and managing the continued availability of spare parts, which is key to the extended lifetime service we offer for our systems."
Electronic Waste,We provide our customers with a guaranteed service roadmap until at least 2030.
Electronic Waste,This means that all support and the necessary services and spare parts they need to maintain their systems is expected to be available through at least 2030 and beyond.
Electronic Waste,"For the TWINSCAN AT systems that are still in operation, we focus on measures to proactively manage their end of life by guaranteeing the availability of spare parts as long as possible on a best-effort basis."
Electronic Waste,"In 2021, the Mature Products and Services (MPS) business line embarked on a new challenge to refurbish and upgrade first-generation NXT lithography machines, in addition to the PAS 5500 and XT systems."
Electronic Waste,"With the NXT platform having established its position as the workhorse of the semiconductor industry, there are more than 200 first-generation NXTs still running production at customer sites around the world."
Electronic Waste,"To support the steep growth in semiconductor manufacturing capacity, especially in 'More-than-"
Electronic Waste,"Moore' markets with less advanced requirements,"
Electronic Waste,"ASML buys back these systems, refurbishes them to the specifications of later-generation systems, and sells them to customers that do not need the specs offered by more advanced machines."
Electronic Waste,"This enables customers to purchase an attractively-priced tool that will support their required cost of ownership targets, while contributing to ASML's commitment to minimize waste and maximize resources."

Accounting,"Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles."
Accounting,"We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company'sinternal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon."
Accounting,These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Accounting,Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.
Accounting,We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Accounting,"Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud."
Accounting,"Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks."
Accounting,"Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements."
Accounting,"Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements."
Accounting,We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Accounting," (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments."
Accounting,"The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates."
Accounting,"The Company's net inventory totaled $10.8 billion as of December 25, 2021, representing 6.4% of total assets."
Accounting,"As explained in ""Note 2: Accounting Policies"" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories."
Accounting,"The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers;"
Accounting,the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory;
Accounting,whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality.
Accounting,"Auditing management's assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand."
Accounting,"Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts."
Accounting,"We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory."
Accounting,"Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management's inventory valuation assessment."
Accounting,We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends.
Accounting,"We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions."
Accounting,"We have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria)."
Accounting,"In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on the COSO criteria."
Accounting,"We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and our report dated January 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon."
Accounting,The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Accounting,Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
Accounting,We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Accounting,Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Accounting,"Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances."
Accounting,A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Accounting,"A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
Accounting,"(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
Accounting,"(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
Accounting,"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
Accounting,"Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

Accounting,"In March 2021, Applied's Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing $7.5 billion in repurchases, which supplemented the previously existing $6.0 billion authorization approved in February 2018."
Accounting,"At October 31, 2021, approximately $5.0 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the repurchase program."
Accounting,"During fiscal 2021, Applied's Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.24 per share."
Accounting,"During fiscal 2020, Applied's Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share."
Accounting,"During fiscal 2019, Applied's Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.21 per share."
Accounting,"Dividends paid during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $838 million, $787 million and $771 million, respectively."
Accounting,"Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied's stockholders."
Accounting,"Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks."
Accounting,"The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a provision under which Applied may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to $500 million for a total commitment of no more than $2.0 billion, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions."
Accounting,"The Revolving Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in February 2025, unless extended as permitted under the Revolving Credit Agreement."
Accounting,"The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by Applied, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to Applied's public debt credit ratings."
Accounting,"The Revolving Credit Agreement includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance as of October 31, 2021."
Accounting,Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $70 million are with Japanese banks.
Accounting,"Applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen."
Accounting,"In August 2019, Applied entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders under which the lenders committed to make an unsecured term loan to Applied of up to $2.0 billion to finance in part Applied's planned acquisition of all outstanding shares of Kokusai Electric, to pay related transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes."
Accounting,"In March 2021, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as subsequently amended, terminated automatically in accordance with its terms upon the termination of the SPA."
Accounting,No amounts were borrowed under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
Accounting,Applied has a short-term commercial paper program under which Applied may issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount of $1.5 billion.
Accounting,"As of October 31, 2021, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future."
Accounting,The commercial paper program is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Agreement and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement reduce the amount of commercial paper notes Applied can issue.
Accounting,"In May 2020, Applied issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% senior unsecured notes due 2030 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2050, in a registered public offering."
Accounting,"In June 2020, Applied used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the outstanding $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.625% senior unsecured notes due October 1, 2020 and $750 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.300% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021, at a total aggregate redemption price of $1.4 billion."
Accounting,"As a result, Applied recognized a $33 million loss on early extinguishment of these senior unsecured notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2020."
Accounting,"Applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion outstanding as of October 31, 2021."
Accounting,See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional discussion of existing debt.
Accounting,Applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on Applied's capital requirements and the availability of financing.
Accounting,"As of October 31, 2021, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $500 million."
Accounting,Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed.
Accounting,"The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported."
Accounting,We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. 
Accounting,"See Note 2, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies."
Accounting,"Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below."
Accounting,Identify the contract with a customer.
Accounting,"We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances."
Accounting,Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
Accounting,"Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract."
Accounting,Determine the transaction price.
Accounting,The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved.
Accounting,Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. 
Accounting,We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. 
Accounting,Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance.
Accounting,Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.
Accounting,Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
Accounting,"For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis."
Accounting,"Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies."
Accounting,Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. 
Accounting,"Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less."
Accounting,"Inventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. "
Accounting,Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. 
Accounting,"Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. "
Accounting,"If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made."
Accounting,Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue.
Accounting,"We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. "
Accounting,We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.
Accounting,"Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards."
Accounting,We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
Accounting,"Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. "
Accounting,"In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made."
Accounting,"Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed."
Accounting,We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.
Accounting,Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
Accounting,Long-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests.
Accounting,"The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value."
Accounting,"In performing a qualitative assessment, we consider business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed byestimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value, including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit."
Accounting,We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach.
Accounting,"Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn."
Accounting,"In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment."
Accounting,"Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit."
Accounting,"In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge."
Accounting,"If after completing the quantitative assessment the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit."
Accounting,"For other long-lived assets, we review them whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable."
Accounting,"If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value."
Accounting,"If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values."
Accounting,"Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods."
Accounting,We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset's carrying value. 
Accounting,"The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset's new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. "
Accounting,Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.
Accounting,"In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we de-recognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows."
Accounting,"For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"" of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K."
Water Stress,"The HOYA Group endeavors to effectively utilize water resources by reusing water and reducing water usage on a global scale, in accordance with its Fundamental Environmental Policies."
Water Stress,The HOYA Group has set numerical targets in each of its business segments and manages its progress in achieving the targets.
Water Stress,"In fiscal 2020, water usage in the HOYA Group was 15,044,000 cubic meters."
Water Stress,"Compared to fiscal 2014, we managed to reduce water usage by 13.3% within the Group as a whole, and by 22.3% in terms of water usage per unit of net sales, having raised the ratio of water reuse."
Water Stress,"Water usage was calculated targeting production bases, based on the usage of city water, industrial water and groundwater identified by using the data aggregation format shared universally within the HOYA Group."
Water Stress,Initiatives to effectively utilize water resources are being carried out in each business segment.
Water Stress,"In the photomask manufacturing process, cleaning is performed by using ultrapure water to remove various chemicals and foreign matter."
Water Stress,"The used water undergoes a process at an effluent treatment facility to be rendered harmless, some of which is subsequently collected and reused."
Water Stress,"The ultrapure water recycling facility, which consists of adsorbents and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, makes it possible to reuse water by removing impurities"
Water Stress,Proper management of water resources
Water Stress,The amount of water received per unit 93% (compared to FY2013 level)
Water Stress,Reduction of the Amount of Water Received in Business Activities
Water Stress,"In response to rising concerns over water problems worldwide, Toshiba Group is promoting sustainable water resource management."
Water Stress,Each of our production sites has incorporated the policy of reducing the volume of water received into its annual plan in order to develop specific strategies and conduct follow-up surveys on an ongoing basis.
Water Stress,We are promoting wide-ranging initiatives including recycling the wastewater generated in sites and introducing systems for using rainwater.
Water Stress,"The total volume of water received in FY2020 was 17.8 million m3 and the volume of water received per unit production was 93% of the total for FY2013, so we achieved our targets."
Water Stress,"Since Toshiba Group has multiple production sites in Southeast Asia, where water risks are relatively high, we will focus our risk management efforts on appropriately dealing with the issues of each region by promoting recycling of wastewater and using rainwater as measures for water-shortage problems as well as by raising the floor of main equipment and making other efforts as flood control measures."
Water Stress,Case: Reducing the Volume of Water Used through the Effective Use of Rainwater
Water Stress,Toshiba JSW Power Systems Pvt. Ltd. (Toshiba JSW) has been reducing the volume of water used by utilizing rainwater and reusing treated water.
Water Stress,"The company stores rainwater in a pond and uses the water for various uses, such as sprinkling water for plants in the premises, cooling water for manufacturing processes, and water for flushing toilets."
Water Stress,The rainwater storage pond is cleaned regularly so that the quality of water is maintained.
Water Stress,The rainwater falling on the factory building roofs is not wasted either; the rainwater is once stored in the rainwater tank equipped with a monitor to grasp the water level.
Water Stress,"The monitor allows us to transfer the rainwater to the pond before it overflows from the tank. Through the use of rainwater, Toshiba JSW reduced 15,000 m3 water used annually."
Water Stress,Case: Reducing the Volume of Water Used through the Reuse of Cleaning Water
Water Stress,Toshiba Hokuto Electronics has succeeded in reducing the volume of water used by reusing wastewater.
Water Stress,"Specifically, wastewater from the pure water cleaning tank for substrates is reused for sprinkling water on the odor control scrubber."
Water Stress,"(This technology was co-developed with Toshiba Materials Co., Ltd.)"
Water Stress,Toshiba Group is working to enhance analysis and management of production sites located in high-water-risk regions and sites that need large amounts of water.
Water Stress,"To analyze data on high-water-risk regions, we used ""Aqueduct"", a water risk assessment tool developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), and we considered water problems from various perspectives, including the risk of pollution by wastewater and level of interest in water issues among area residents, in addition to the physical amounts of water resources in individual river basins."
Water Stress,"Working in collaboration with InterRisk Research Institute & Consulting, Inc., Toshiba Group selected eight production sites located in areas where water is used in large quantities or with high water risks to conduct water risk assessment at such sites."
Water Stress,"We assessed water demand (current demand and future trends), water disaster risks, and water contamination vulnerabilities (public health and ecosystems) from various perspectives in river basins where our sites are located."
Water Stress,"Based on the information acquired, we will review water risk prevention measures going forward."
Water Stress,Correlation analysis between rainfall and the amount of water used in regions with Toshiba production sites
Water Stress,"Also, Toshiba Group is analyzing the correlation between the monthly amount of water received by factories and rainfall in regions where our sites are located."
Water Stress,"Assuming that months with small amounts of rainfall are periods with high water risks, we aim to contribute to water resource conservation in surrounding areas by reducing the amount of water received as much as possible."
Water Stress,"In the months enclosed by blue circles, the amounts of water received and rainfall are large. By contrast, in the months enclosed by light blue circles, the amount of rainfall is low. In these months, there is a need to reduce the amount of water used."
Water Stress,"By performing such an analysis at each site, we aim to contribute to water conservation in areas with high water risks as well as to raise awareness about water resources at sites in areas assessed as having low water risks."
Water Stress,Case: Reducing the amount of pure water used while the system is in standby mode
Water Stress,"Kaga Toshiba Electronics manufactures semiconductor products that are installed in small electronic devices, automobiles, industrial equipment, and elsewhere."
Water Stress,"It uses a large amount of water during the manufacturing process and for air conditioning equipment, and this use has become an environmental and cost issue."
Water Stress,"Thus, the company has worked to reduce the amount of pure water used in wafer cleaning, which is one part of the manufacturing process."
Water Stress,"In the wafer cleaning process, liquid medicine and a large volume of pure water are used to remove dirt from wafers."
Water Stress,"Since even fine dust that is invisible to the eye can affect the product, maintaining water quality is very important."
Water Stress,The company considered whether it could reduce the amount of pure water used without affecting product quality and focused on the wafer cleaning system's waiting time.
Water Stress,The wafer cleaning system continues to supply pure water even while in standby mode in order to prevent any degradation in water quality and the generation of bacteria.
Water Stress,"The Engineering and Manufacturing Divisions worked together to review the amount of pure water supplied, and as a result, they successfully reduced the amount of pure water used by approximately 1,800 m3 per year while maintaining water quality."
Water Stress,Case : Waste management and local communication that support semiconductor production
Water Stress,Japan Semiconductor Corporation Oita Operations manufactures mixed signal ICs and other semiconductors.
Water Stress,"During production, the plant uses many chemicals, all of which are appropriately treated in order to discharge wastewater that meets the various applicable standards."
Water Stress,"In addition, the plant uses wastewater to breed Japanese freshwater snails, which fireflies feed on, and has worked with local community organizations, local government organizations, and companies in the vicinity to release the snails in the upstream of the Kitabana River, thereby successfully breeding fireflies."
Water Stress,"For these activities, the plant was awarded the Ministry of the Environment Award at the FY2015 Model Environmental Initiative Award Celebration held by the Ministry of the Environment."
Water Stress,The plant will continue to promote local communication while expanding its ecosystem preservation activities.
Water Stress,Working with a local community association to confirm the release of freshwater snails(feed for fireflies)

Water Stress,"The Company annually requests key suppliers to formally report water-related data, either via the Responsible Business Alliance or the CDP reporting methodologies and platforms."
Water Stress,"This data includes performance indicators such as annual water withdrawal, water discharge, and water recycle/reuse volumes"
Water Stress,"For the most recent supplier data collection period, the Company's coverage of engagement was 96 percent of procurement spend."
Water Stress,"Since one of the most straightforward indicators of impact especially to water-stressed areas is water withdrawal, the Company has been encouraging suppliers to set up water reduction targets since 2014."
Water Stress,"During the last data collection period, 95 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with public water reduction goals."
Water Stress,The Company also conducts an annual water risk assessment using the World Resources Institute 'Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas' and the WWF's 'Water Risk Filter'.
Water Stress,"In FY 2020/21 reporting period, the assessment covered supplier manufacturing locations that correspond to over 95 percent of its procurement spend."
Water Stress,"The assessment allows the Company to identify the potential water risks within the supply chain, including suppliers with baseline water stress, seasonal variability, drought, and coastal flooding risks."
Water Stress,"As a next step, the Company plans to share the assessment results with the impacted suppliers and work together to support water stewardship."
Water Stress,The Company annually requests key suppliers to formally report waste-related data via the Responsible Business Alliance methodologies and platforms.
Water Stress,This data includes indicators such as annual hazardous and nonhazardous waste volumes.
Water Stress,"Waste prevention is the most preferable option in the waste management hierarchy, and the Company encourages suppliers to set up public waste reduction targets."
Water Stress,"During the last data collection period, 95 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with public waste reduction goals."
Water Stress,"As one of the first companies of our size to acknowledge water as a human right, we have a vision to become ""net water positive."""

Water Stress,"Good quality fresh water is vital to our business, as a key ingredient for our beverages, to maintain sanitary conditions throughout our operations, to grow the crops within our agricultural supply chain and to produce other raw materials necessary for our business."
Water Stress,We expect that future water dependency in our company-owned and third-party manufacturing operations will change with improvements in both operational and agricultural water-use efficiency and water availability.
Water Stress,"With that in mind, and given the risks facing good quality fresh water, we work in local watersheds to replenish the supply of fresh water."
Water Stress,PepsiCo aims to replenish more than 100 percent of the water we draw for our operations in high-risk watersheds by 2030.
Water Stress,"In other words, we aim to put back more water than we take from local watersheds."
Water Stress,"While we can make a significant impact in water stewardship through the actions we take across our value chain, we also have opportunities to help mitigate water insecurity on a broader level, through advocacy for improved water governance and through increased collective action."
Water Stress,We support existing collaborative efforts to address water risk and mitigate water insecurity.
Water Stress,"In the absence of current collaborations, we seek out new opportunities to partner with others."
Water Stress,We do this by advocating for the adoption of smart water policies and regulations; by sharing information and best practices with water stakeholders; and by providing public education and training for consumers and communities.
Water Stress,"In addition, we joined the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) in 2018 and aim to adopt the AWS Standard at all of our high water-risk facilities by 2025, using it as a vehicle for advocacy and to help ensure that freshwater resources in high water-risk locations are available for all water stakeholders."
Water Stress,"Water is a fundamental human right, and the fact that billions of people have been left with limited access to it for decades is a problem of global importance that must be addressed rapidly."
Water Stress,"Today, 2 billion people— about 1 in 4— lack access to safely managed drinking water services."
Water Stress,The global demand for freshwater will exceed the supply and nearly 700 million people are projected to be displaced by intense water insecurity as early as 2030.
Water Stress,"Water insecurity puts communities at risk, increasing negative health outcomes, decreasing food availability and, in the worst cases, driving communities out from their homes."
Water Stress,"Over the last 15 years, PepsiCo and The PepsiCo Foundation have helped more than 59 million people gain access to safe water through distribution, purification and conservation programs - putting PepsiCo and The PepsiCo Foundation more than halfway to our goal of providing access to safe water for 100 million people by 2030."
Water Stress,"The PepsiCo Foundation has invested more than $53 million in safe water access programs, catalyzing nearly $700 million in additional funding from other donors."
Water Stress,"Our community water programs, hosted in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa primarily, are designed to help improve water security, including building sanitation facilities and community water systems, providing loans to families to build water infrastructure in their homes, supporting local water entrepreneurs, installing community water access points and helping to rehabilitate natural springs."
Water Stress,Our global approach to water stewardship is led by a team of water experts in PepsiCo's Global Sustainability Office.
Water Stress,"They, in turn, work in partnership with our respective sector teams and external partners to execute our strategy and work toward achieving our commitments."
Water Stress,"PepsiCo's water strategy applies to the entire organization, including all companies, entities or groups over which financial control is exercised."
Water Stress,A sustainability subcommittee of the Executive Committee includes water stewardship among its areas of focus.
Water Stress,"At the Board level, the Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee oversees key water risks and practices."
Water Stress,"Through our Enterprise Risk Management process, we identify and assess water-related risks within our direct operations and other stages of our value chain twice a year."
Water Stress,"Supplementing that process, we also conduct an in-depth global water risk assessment of all our company-owned operations on a rolling three year cycle."
Water Stress,"Partnering with a specialized environmental consultancy, we have developed a robust water risk assessment process that leverages multiple data sets and local insights."
Water Stress,"This process is designed to provide PepsiCo with a holistic view of all water-related risks, both current and future, in our global manufacturing locations."
Water Stress,"Some of the inputs used include: the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct tool, local site risk assessment surveys, and independent expert experience and knowledge operating within the watersheds."
Water Stress,"This helps us to determine and quantify the level of physical, regulatory and reputational water risk."
Water Stress,The outcome of our operational water risk assessment informs which sites are designated as high risk and allows us to focus our efforts and resources where it matters most.
Water Stress,"Each year, we measure and report on our progress towards our water goals. Our reporting on 2020 progress is reflective of the goals in place during that year."
Water Stress,"Going forward, we will report against the goals announced as part of our PepsiCo Positive ambition."
Water Stress,Measuring our agricultural water consumption requires the support of hundreds of farmers in a complex global value chain.
Water Stress,"We collect and publish agricultural water-use efficiency data every three years, or sooner if warranted by organizational changes, updated methodologies or more accurate data."
Water Stress,Our most recent data collection was conducted in 2020.
Water Stress,"Between 2015 and 2020, we improved direct agriculture water-use efficiency in our high water-risk regions by 14 percent."
Water Stress,"As the science evolves, we continue to improve the integrity and efficiency of our data collection, processing, and reporting system."
Water Stress,"For baseline years 2015 and all subsequent years, data has been recalculated utilizing our enhanced 2020 methodology."
Water Stress,"In 2020, PepsiCo had 99 high water-risk manufacturing locations as defined by our global water risk assessment process."
Water Stress,These locations span five continents and 18 countries and account for more than 30 percent of our company-owned manufacturing sites.
Water Stress,Twelve of our top 24 markets have manufacturing operations in high water-risk locations and high water-risk sites account for more than 20 percent of our company-owned production output.
Water Stress,"To track our operational water-use efficiency goal, we measure both water withdrawal (the total amount of water that we remove from a water source) in high water-risk areas and non-high water-risk areas as well as the volume of product produced."
Water Stress,"In 2020, we withdrew approximately 82,700 ML water across all company owned operations — 21 percent from regions of high water-risk. Water consumption (the amount we withdraw that is not returned to its watershed) across PepsiCo was approximately 28,100 ML water — 20 percent from regions of high water-risk."
Water Stress,"In 2020, we recorded a 15 percent efficiency improvement in our water-use efficiency rate at our high water-risk locations when compared to our 2015 baseline."
Water Stress,This represents a nearly 6 percent improvement from the prior year and builds on a 25 percent improvement already achieved between 2006 and 2015 as part of our Performance with Purpose goals.
Water Stress,"During 2020, in Mexico City we successfully deployed our first circular water project in collaboration with a franchise bottler and plan to expand further across other LATAM locations."
Water Stress,"In 2020, through our projects across the globe, we replenished more than 3.2 billion liters of water, or 18 percent of the water we consumed in our company-owned manufacturing facilities in high-risk watersheds."
Water Stress,"While COVID-19 presented challenges for our partners on the ground, progress was driven largely by our support of the Greater Cape Town Water Fund and our new reforestation partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation in California."
Water Stress,Access to safe water has long been a priority for PepsiCo.
Water Stress,"Between 2006 and 2020, partnerships funded by The PepsiCo Foundation have provided more than 55 million people with access to safe water, surpassing our 2025 safe water access goal early."
Water Stress,"Now, we have extended this goal to 100 million people by 2030."
Water Stress,"When COVID-19 struck, we supported WaterAid's global emergency response with the installation of handwashing stations and mass media awareness campaigns."
Water Stress,"In Pakistan and India, The PepsiCo Foundation helped fund a prevention campaign reaching more than 24 million people with crucial messages on social distancing and handwashing with soap."
Water Stress,"In 2019 we launched pilot projects to adopt the AWS Standard at high water-risk facilities in South Africa, Pakistan and Mexico, with a fourth pilot launched in the United States in 2020."
Water Stress,These pilots stood up cross-functional teams of PepsiCo associates who have come together to diagnose local water risks and opportunities for the facilities to be good water stewards.
Water Stress,"At the end of 2020, we had 10 high water-risk facilities in the process of adopting the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard."
Water Stress,PepsiCo draws on the expertise and local knowledge of an array of partners in order to deliver on its water stewardship ambitions.
Water Stress,"These include non-profit organizations, research institutions, developmental experts as well as collaborative initiatives."
Water Stress,"In the coming year, we will work to bring our new ""net water positive"" vision to life."
Water Stress,This will include prioritizing.
Water Stress,Agricultural water-use efficiency: Continually improving water-use efficiency towards our 2025 goal with a particular focus on our most severely high water-risk growing regions.
Water Stress,"Operational water-use efficiency: Working towards achieving ""best-in-class"" or ""world-class"" water-use efficiency at our nearly 100 high-risk sites, more than 350 third-party bottler and franchisee facilities in high-risk watersheds, nearly 200 other company-owned sites and more than 440 other franchisees and third-party bottler locations."
Water Stress,"Water replenishment: In high water-risk areas, replenish more than 100% of the water that we use back into the local watershed by 2030."
Water Stress,Community access to safe water: Implementing new programs and expanding existing partnerships to make progress on our safe water access goal benefiting a total of 100 million people by 2030.
Water Stress,Advocacy: Scaling up our efforts to start applying the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard at our high water-risk facilities in new geographies.
Water Stress,"Reduce freshwater use, transition to alternative sources, improve the quality of the water we discharge, and protect shared water resources."
Water Stress,"Water resource management is an integral part of protecting the environment surrounding our worksites and at the same time, an essential part of the product production process."
Water Stress,"We focus on the 3Rs - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - in managing water resources."
Water Stress,Each of our worksites sets a water consumption target considering the water resources situation in the region as one of our KPIs.
Water Stress,"We recognize the importance of water in sustainable, social, and corporate management and fulfill our responsibility as a global corporate citizen to protect water resources."
Water Stress,"Evaluate the impact of our business activities, such as production on water resources, to minimize risks while continuing to explore and introduce new technologies."
Water Stress,Establish the preservation and sustainability of water resources as part of our corporate culture; help employees understand their responsibility for water resource management and consider the impact of our operations on local communities and environment as a top priority.
Water Stress,"Based on guidelines on water resources, actively cooperate with local and central governments as well as international organizations, to establish and execute policies aimed at protecting and conserving water resources."
Water Stress,"Ensure clear and transparent disclosure of corporate policies and activities regarding the use of water resources to our stakeholders, including local communities."
Water Stress,"Of all the countries where we operate in globally, five are identified as water-stressed countries, where a total of twelve worksites are based."
Water Stress,We use water management tools developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to identify whether our worksites are located in water-stressed regions.
Water Stress,"To determine water stress of each water basin and the water-related risks for every ten years, we utilize the tools developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Resource Institute (WRI)."
Water Stress,We also use CDP's Water Guidance to subdivide the water risks at our worksites located in water-stressed regions and respond with risk-specific strategies.
Water Stress,"We classify water resources into four categories: sewage, wastewater, industrial water, and ultra-pure water. In order to increase water reuse at each regional subsidiary, the amount of water reused in each category is managed and measured through the Global Environment, Health & Safety System (G-EHS system) every month."
Water Stress,"We have installed underground water pollution prevention facilities where required, and discharged water is safely treated using internal and external treatment facilities."
Water Stress,"When discharging used water directly into a stream through our in-house treatment facilities, we apply in-house standards that go beyond the required legal standard."
Water Stress,"We also pursue structural improvements, such as improving our manufacturing processes and establishing recycling systems."
Water Stress,"As a result, we reused 68,555,000 tonnes of water in 2019, up 10% from the preceding year."
Water Stress,"At our semiconductor plants that show high water usage, we changed the process control values, switched wastewater treatment methods, and optimized operations and as a result, achieved daily water savings of 4,461 tonnes, exceeding our savings target."
Water Stress,"In addition, the Pyeongtaek site, which had installed large-scale new water facilities over past few years, set mid- to long-term water reduction targets, optimizing facility operation efficiency and applying existing saving measures."
Water Stress,"To celebrate World Water Day each year, our manufacturing sites across the globe carry out river and marine ecosystem conservation activities together with local governments, civil organizations and nearby schools."
Water Stress,"In 2019, more than 5,000 employees from 26 worksites in countries including South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam, took part in volunteer activities to help preserve ecosystems near worksites."
Water Stress,"These activities included cleaning up nearby streams, conducting water preservation education initiatives and campaigns, and other water resources CSR activities."
Water Stress,Water is an essential resource in the manufacture of semiconductors.
Water Stress,"As semiconductor technologies have become more complex, demand for water has grown."
Water Stress,"Therefore, reducing the amount of water we use and properly treating the water we do use are among Micron's top environmental priorities."
Water Stress,"Micron proactively manages water consumption by identifying opportunities to increase water efficiency and reduce raw water demand, supporting the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 6, which focuses on clean water and sanitation."
Water Stress,"Our manufacturing sites generate ultrapure water from a combination of recycled water from our operations and local, untreated water resources."
Water Stress,Wastewater from our operations that is not recycled or otherwise reused on-site is treated to comply with local standards and then discharged.
Water Stress,"Actions such as enhancing reuse and recycling infrastructure and managing water efficiency, especially at existing facilities, will drive us toward this goal."
Water Stress,"Increasingly, we are incorporating water saving measures during the design stage of new buildings and industrial processes."
Water Stress,Sustainable management of our water footprint begins with understanding where we obtain water.
Water Stress,"Globally, the primary source for water at manufacturing locations is the municipal supply, underscoring the importance of partnering with local water authorities."
Water Stress,"We consider these relationships within their local context, seeking to understand the implications of different geographies, climates, watersheds and infrastructure."
Water Stress,We then use the information we have gathered to determine the best approach to water management at each site.
Water Stress,A water risk assessment using the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct tool has helped us better understand local water conditions.
Water Stress,"Recent updates to Aqueduct note that only 1% of Micron's total water withdrawals come from areas of high water stress — specifically our facility in Xi'an, China."
Water Stress,"Still, many of our locations face potential water stress, and we recognize the importance of being a good partner in managing local water resources."
Water Stress,"Our fabs in Taiwan, for example, have been designed to enable the highest water recycling rates in the Micron network."
Water Stress,"A wastewater reclamation system installed at our wafer fab in Taoyuan in 2019 reduces our annual municipal water consumption by over 450,000 cubic meters."
Water Stress,"As the location weathers a historic drought, we are working closely with local authorities and carefully managing our water use."
Water Stress,"Wastewater treatment methods may vary by site but include membrane filtration, ion-resin adsorption, precipitation, bio-oxidation and neutralization."
Water Stress,We routinely sample wastewater discharges for compliance with environmental standards.
Water Stress,"In CY20, we discharged 42.4 million cubic meters of treated wastewater, with 85% of that discharge sent to publicly operated treatment works."
Water Stress,The sites also have staff responsible for the ongoing operation and routine maintenance of wastewater systems to safeguard proper performance over time.
Water Stress,One way Micron will achieve its water conservation goal is by getting involved in local water restoration projects in the communities where we operate.
Water Stress,"Boise State University's Intermountain Bird Observatory and Diane Moore Nature Center is just across the Boise River from the pumphouse for Micron's headquarters and primary technology development fab, providing a direct line of sight from one of Micron's water sources to our clean water goal."
Water Stress,"By ""adopting"" this stretch of the river, Micron will support the restoration of a side channel that runs parallel to the river and improve the quality of 10.9 million cubic meters of water a year."
Water Stress,"If the main stem of a river is the highway, a side channel is the service road where the traffic flows at a slower pace."
Water Stress,"In the case of the Boise River, it is also where fish and wildlife can access food, shelter and rest."
Water Stress,"The side channel provides cleaner, cold water to target the higher dissolved oxygen needs of trout spawn and juveniles."
Water Stress,"Micron is providing funding for the design and construction of the project, which will reopen the side channel that has been filled in over the years."
Water Stress,These amenities will engage visitors and bolster community STEM education programs.
Water Stress,"As water stress manifests to varying degrees around the world and across the apparel supply chain, we see opportunities to take additional steps to use the science and tools at our disposal to focus reduction actions where they are most critically needed."
Water Stress,"Our track record in water stewardship dates to the early 1990s, when we established the apparel industry's first wastewater quality guidelines."
Water Stress,"In 2019, we published our 2025 Water Action Strategy, which leverages the best and most current publicly available data sources to address water stress in the supply chain."
Water Stress,"The strategy is the driving force behind our geographically contextual, facility-level targets to address local water stress."
Water Stress,It also informs updates to our Water<Less® program in which we are incorporating these contextual water targets.
Water Stress,We also held a seminar with other brands and stakeholder partners to discuss our thinking and opportunities for collaboration.
Water Stress,"Furthermore, part of the 2025 Water Action Strategy focuses on driving resilience beyond the four walls of manufacturing facilities in areas experiencing high water stress."
Water Stress,This is intended to bring greater resilience to our operations and the communities and watersheds touched by our business.
Water Stress,Jeanologia Environmental Impact Measurement (EIM) software is a third-party digital platform developed to measure water and chemicals use in garment finishing processes for individual products.
Water Stress,"We continue encouraging suppliers to use the EIM self-accreditation tool to improve the environmental performance of jeans finishing, and more LS&Co. suppliers are doing so each season."
Water Stress,The EIM tool is also used in our two owned-and-operated factories.
Water Stress,"Water<Less®, our flagship water stewardship program launched in 2011 to maximize water efficiency in apparel production, has become more than a series of garment finishing techniques and water recycling guidelines."
Water Stress,"Today, the Water<Less® program is the driving force for our continued innovation and improvement in water stewardship."
Water Stress,The Water<Less® program was originally built on technical innovations that save water compared with traditional methods in fabric development and garment finishing.
Water Stress,"We continue deploying and scaling new water-saving innovations, while also recognizing that the program highlights some of the opportunities apparel companies have to decrease manufacturing water use through a variety of changes in equipment and processes."
Water Stress,"As of the end of 2020, 67% of all LS&Co. products were made using Water<Less® finishing techniques or in facilities that meet our water recycle and reuse guidelines."
Water Stress,"And through 2020, we have saved almost 13 billion liters cumulatively since the Water<Less® program began in 2011, thanks to water-saving techniques, more efficient equipment, as well as our Reuse and Recycle standard for suppliers."
Water Stress,We use the widely respected World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to help us gain a basin-level understanding of the local water stress contexts where we operate.
Water Stress,"We used the Water Risk Atlas to categorize our suppliers into areas of low, medium and high water stress."
Water Stress,"As we work with suppliers on water efficiency targets, the low and medium stress areas receive progressive efficiency targets, while suppliers in areas of high water stress are assigned aggressive absolute water use reduction targets compared to a 2018 baseline."
Water Stress,"Collectively, the targets are intended to contribute to our overall 50% reduction target in areas of high water stress by 2025."
Water Stress,One of our key 2025 Water Action Strategy intentions is to evolve our Water<Less® program into a facility-level qualification to simplify the program implementation and deepen our impact in local communities.
Water Stress,We have also set intermediate 2021 and 2023 reduction targets to serve as milestones for suppliers as they progress to their final 2025 target.
Water Stress,These intermediate targets will indicate which suppliers are on track and can be considered Water<Less® suppliers for a two-year period.
Water Stress,"Suppliers that already used recycled and reused water for production purposes prior to 2018 (our baseline year) are allowed partial ""credit"" toward their 2025 contextual water targets in recognition of their proactive measures to reduce impacts."
Water Stress,Any products manufactured by a designated Water<Less® supplier are deemed as Water<Less® garments in the marketplace.
Water Stress,"LS&Co.'s efforts to address manufacturing water use and pollution converged in 2014, when we became the first major apparel brand to author a standard for water recycling and reuse for manufacturing facilities."
Water Stress,"Our Recycle & Reuse Standard and Guidelines establish that facilities must adhere to the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Foundation's wastewater guidelines' ""progressive"" standard and recycle more than 20% of the water used in manufacturing."
Water Stress,"Between 2014 and 2020, approximately 8.5 billion liters of water have been recycled at product and fabric manufacturing facilities that apply our water Recycle & Reuse Standard."
Water Stress,The reduction from 2019 to 2020 reflects the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on production.
Water Stress,"At our owned-and-operated factories in Poland and South Africa, a variety of water-savings processes are in place."
Water Stress,Both facilities use Water<Less® production processes and have installed water efficient retrofits on washing machines.
Water Stress,"The team also installed a water treatment plant that receives and treats the recycled water, enabling the facility to use 100% recycled water in manufacturing, rather than relying on the stressed local freshwater supply."
Water Stress,"At the same time, product development and finishing teams increased their use of LS&Co.'s Water<Less® finishing techniques, which reduced water use for manufacturing by more than 25%."
Water Stress,"These actions allowed our factory to decouple its production from Cape Town's fresh water, helping to protect local water supplies and build resilience to future water shortages."
Water Stress,"In addition, LS&Co. grants to The Nature Conservancy's Greater Cape Town Water Fund enabled training and work for local women who have been removing invasive shrubs, freeing up more than 120 million liters for the local water supply — part of the 4.8 billion liters of water freed up per year under the fund."
Water Stress,"In 2020, the Dockers® brand partnered with surfer Jon Rose and his foundation Waves For Water in a three-year collaboration to help provide clean drinking water to communities in need."
Water Stress,"Waves for Water provides access to clean water through portable water filtration systems, digging and renovating borehole wells, and rainwater harvesting and storage systems."
Water Stress,Some of these projects are in or near communities where workers in the Dockers® supply chain live.
Water Stress,The first items available in the Dockers® Waves for Water collection made their appearance in Spring 2021.
Water Stress,"Water pollution also contributes to water stress, so ensuring that the water put back into the environment is clean and safe is as important as addressing water consumption."
Water Stress,Our partnership with the ZDHC Foundation and success at meeting our own zero discharge of hazardous chemicals goal in 2020 contribute to cleaner wastewater from the apparel manufacturing process.
Water Stress,We are working to scale the adoption of ZDHC's Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and our own Screened Chemistry approach to encourage more industry peers to adopt preferred chemical lists and screening any new formulations for hazards.
Water Stress,"As with our other environmental and social commitments, our progress is stronger when we collaborate with others."
Water Stress,"For this reason, LS&Co. has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact CEO Water Mandate since it began in 2008."
Water Stress,The CEO Water Mandate mobilizes business leaders to address global water challenges and advance water stewardship.
Water Stress,The Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) is the leading environmental non-governmental organization monitoring corporate environmental performance across China.
Water Stress,"LS&Co. uses the IPE Blue Map environmental database to monitor our suppliers in China, all of which are registered to the database."
Water Stress,"We have also shared our supplier factory list and data with the IPE Green Supply Chain Map, which provides real-time performance data and historical trend information related to air emissions and wastewater discharge."
Water Stress,"LS&Co. suppliers have disclosed more than 375 Pollutant Release and Transfer Register forms since 2016, covering 100% of higher environmental impact suppliers since 2018, and we have encouraged many additional suppliers to disclose as well."
Water Stress,"The higher-impact suppliers are identified through lifecycle analysis data to determine impact levels at each stage of the supply chain, focusing on water consumption in the context of regional water stress, as well as energy use, carbon intensity, chemical use and wastewater quality."
Water Stress,"Our supplier-level water and climate, or energy, data for a given year comes from third-party-verified Higg data we receive in September of the following year."
Water Stress,"For water, we are using the Higg data available to us at the time of this report and plan to update our complete water data for 2020 when it is available later in 2021."
Water Stress,"For 2020, we decided to make the third-party data verification step optional to help suppliers address costs in light of the pandemic's financial impacts on their businesses."
Water Stress,"In 2021, we are working with suppliers to resume normal data verification processes."
Water Stress,"As of this report's publication, many suppliers had not yet submitted their 2020 Higg data."
Water Stress,This affects results for both our climate and water footprints.
Water Stress,Our approach to the use of estimates in our climate data is described in the Climate Action section.
Water Stress,"Starting in 2022, we will move to qualify our Water<Less® program at the facility level."
Water Stress,"This means that mills and factories that meet the facility-level contextual targets we issue — which will vary depending on the degree of water stress — will qualify as Water<Less® facilities, as will all the fabric or products coming from those facilities."
Water Stress,"Implementing such a facility-level approach both simplifies the administration of the Water<Less® program and amplifies our impact, because the Scope of facility-level targets also encompasses other brands' production volume manufactured in the same supplier facility."
Water Stress,The net result of meeting our 50% reduction target in areas of high water stress by 2025 will thus have positive ripple effects beyond the Scope of LS&Co.'s products.
Water Stress,"Although we provide our suppliers the flexibility to choose their preferred approach to meet their facility-level targets, our existing Water<Less® techniques, EIM measurement software, Recycle & Reuse Standard and the PaCT partnership will remain pillars of our new water strategy and serve as key tools for facilities to meet their targets."
Water Stress,Our water stewardship efforts will continue to expand beyond the factory walls of our suppliers.
Water Stress,"After all, our lifecycle analysis of a pair of 501® jeans shows that 68% of the necessary water is for cotton cultivation."
Water Stress,Our product circularity work similarly benefits our water efforts because it reduces the amount of water required to create virgin materials.
Water Stress,The vision laid out in our Water Action Strategy also includes a shift toward a more basin-level perspective that considers the health of the entire watersheds where we operate.
Water Stress,A great example is our partnership with The Nature Conservancy to restore habitat upstream from our South Africa factory to improve stream flows.
Water Stress,"We have also partnered with World Wildlife Fund, Earth Genome and Arizona State University to identify and diagnose sources of water stress in the Ravi River basin surrounding Lahore, Pakistan."
Water Stress,"Using a mapping tool, local stakeholders can use findings on water levels, supply and demand, and forecasted stress to bring the basin back into balance."
Water Stress,The ultimate goal is to replicate this work beyond the Ravi River and inspire collective action.
Water Stress,"Trane Technologies' use of water within our manufacturing process is minimal; however, we recognize water as a critical element of the natural and social ecosystems, and the risk that water scarcity poses to communities around the world."
Water Stress,We assess our water scarcity risk annually using the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tool during our enterprise-wide risk assessment and consider our risk to be low.
Water Stress,We operate 14 facilities within water-stressed areas.
Water Stress,These facilities with high to extremely high water-stress risks account for only 8% of our total water use in 2021.
Water Stress,"Nevertheless, we continually work to minimize our water use and protect natural watersheds while looking for ways to capture water and return it to bodies of water with the ambition to achieve a net positive impact on water in water-stressed areas by 2030."
Water Stress,We track monthly water use using the Benchmark ESG/ GensuiteTM EHS management system.
Water Stress,"Since 2019, we decreased our water use at facilities located within waterstressed regions by 18%."
Water Stress,We are a member of the Alliance of Water Stewardship and continue to work with our peer companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to develop solutions that will restore and improve water conditions in water-stressed areas so millions of people will maintain access to safe drinking water.
Water Stress,Effluent discharge is monitored against local and federal regulatory limitations using the WaterWatchTM tool within the Benchmark ESG/GensuiteTM platform.
Water Stress,"For each effluent, we maintain internal action thresholds to recognize changing conditions and adjust pretreatment systems before a regulatory discharge limit is exceeded."
Water Stress,Our operating standards and procedures help us strive for zero wastewater exceedances every year.
Water Stress,See more water metrics in our ESG Data Center.
Water Stress,We have completed the CDP Water disclosure annually since 2008.
Water Stress,"Water and climate issues are inextricably connected, often called the water-climate nexus, so we approach the two in tandem."
Water Stress,The impacts of climate change often manifest as water-related events like droughts and floods.
Water Stress,"At the same time, nearly half of all water withdrawn in the U.S. is used to keep power plants cool, and additional water is used for geothermal and other forms of renewable energy."
Water Stress,"Conversely, energy is used to pump water from aquifers for consumption, for water treatment and distribution, and for heating and cooling."
Water Stress,This presents an opportunity for us to mitigate some water and climate impacts simultaneously.
Water Stress,"For instance, many of our Water<Less® techniques also reduce energy use by decreasing the amount of water pumped into the factory."
Water Stress,"And the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT) program, a key pillar of our climate efforts, helps to strengthen suppliers' water reduction performance to achieve their facility-level water targets."
Water Stress,"An ongoing consideration in any environmental improvement initiative is the need for balance so that the reduction of impacts in one area, such as wastewater treatment, do not cause knock-on or secondary effects in others, such as energy use."
Water Stress,"This government program incentivizes suppliers to recycle wastewater sludge onsite, but doing so requires a lot of energy."
Water Stress,"Through this holistic approach, we can ensure we are creating the most positive climate impact possible."
Water Stress,Water is essential to life.
Water Stress,We depend on it for our survival.
Water Stress,The basic need has shaped how human societies have advanced over time.
Water Stress,"Explorers from pre-Columbian times and the age of antiquity to NASA have lived by the motto ""follow the water"" as they have sought and continue to seek to discover new opportunities for the expansion of human civilization."
Water Stress,"While water is plentiful - covering 70% of the Earth's surface - 97% of this water is saline, located in our oceans, and not fit to drink or use for crops."
Water Stress,"And as human civilization has expanded, we have reached the point globally where humanity depletes the available freshwater supply at a rate of 4.3 trillion cubic meters every year - the majority of which goes to agricultural and industrial uses."
Water Stress,This needs to change.
Water Stress,We're tackling our water consumption in two ways: reducing our water use intensity - or the water we use per megawatt of energy used for our operations - and replenishing water in the water- stressed regions we operate.
Water Stress,This means that by 2030 Microsoft will replenish more water than it consumes on a global basis.
Water Stress,"As with our other environmental commitments, we hope these steps will help contribute to a growing movement to address the world's sustainability needs."
Water Stress,More momentum is clearly needed.
Water Stress,And climate change is only intensifying this water shortage.
Water Stress,The U.N. estimates that one in four people may live in a country affected by chronic shortages of freshwater by 2050.
Water Stress,"According to the World Bank, this climate-induced reduction in freshwater availability, coupled with increased demand, could reduce water availability in cities by more than 66% by 2050."
Water Stress,"Getting ahead of the world's water crisis will require a reduction in the amount of water humans use to operate economies and societies, as well as a concerted effort to ensure there is sufficient water in the places it is needed most."
Water Stress,This will require a transformation in the way we manage our water systems and a concerted effort for all organizations to account for and balance their water use.
Water Stress,"As a global technology company Microsoft is prepared to act on both accounts, taking responsibility for our own water use and partnering on technology platforms to help others do the same."
Water Stress,"Over the past year we have committed Microsoft to becoming a carbon negative, zero waste company that is building a new planetary computing platform to transform the way we monitor, model, and ultimately manage Earth's natural systems."
Water Stress,Our pledge today to become water positive by 2030 adds a fourth pillar to this work.
Water Stress,"And as in our other areas, we're committed not only to setting ambitious goals for ourselves but using technology to better help our customers to do the same."
Water Stress,"By 2030 we will be water positive, meaning we will replenish more water than we use."
Water Stress,We'll do this by putting back more water in stressed basins than our global water consumption across all basins.
Water Stress,The amount returned will be determined by how much water we use and how stressed the basin is.
Water Stress,"Our replenishment strategy will include investments in projects such as wetland restoration and the removal of impervious surfaces like asphalt, which will help replenish water back into the basins that need it most."
Water Stress,We will focus our replenishment efforts on roughly 40 highly stressed basins where we have operations.
Water Stress,"This reflects a science-based assessment of the world's water basins. The majority of the world's freshwater is divided into 16,396 basins, each of which has been assigned a ""baseline water stress"" score by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a leading nonprofit global research organization that focuses on natural resources."
Water Stress,"Globally there are 4,717 basins that fall into this category."
Water Stress,"All of this work will build on our ongoing investments, and advances water reduction and replenishment across our operations."

Water Stress,"Since 2017, Dow has been working on reducing its water consumption, achieving a 30% reduction."
Water Stress,One key project involved the collection of rainwater.
Water Stress,"The rainwater was stored via recharge bore caverns, increasing the water table and improving water quality."
Water Stress,"In Map Ta Phut, Thailand, a new water recycling technology was installed."
Water Stress,The cascading scheme reuses the blowdown of a cooling tower and reject stream from the reverse osmosis unit as makeup water for a second cooling tower.
Water Stress,"This project is recycling 1,100 metric tons/day, corresponding to a 5% reduction in overall site water consumption while generating an NPV of $0.85 million."
Water Stress,"Only a small proportion of water intake ends up in products (e.g., consumption)."
Water Stress,"The total volume of water intake globally has been relatively consistent as a result of the combined impact of process efficiencies, business portfolio changes and growth."
Water Stress,We strive to further reduce overall intake by exploring sustainable water circularity options looking at both internal and external sources.
Water Stress,"Rainwater is recovered in multiple locations and reused for firewater and other purposes, but rainwater volume compared to other intakes is relatively small."
Water Stress,"In 2020, our overall water intake increased, due to an increase in seawater intake for cooling purposes."
Water Stress,"In 2020, the freshwater intake intensity at these sites was 10.63, nearly equal to the 2015 baseline."
Water Stress,All sites will be migrated to the new standard for reporting in January 2022.
Water Stress,"Roughly 80% of Dow's freshwater intake at our six key water-stressed sites is at our largest manufacturing site in Freeport, Texas."
Water Stress,"Additional efforts were completed in 2020 to reduce freshwater intake at that site, including:"
Water Stress,"Installation of water meters: The Freeport site is located along the Brazos River, a seasonally stressed river where both extreme rainfalls and drought co-exist."
Water Stress,"In 2021, two new water meters will be installed in order to distinguish water losses associated with weather and actual water used by our own manufacturing assets and other water users."
Water Stress,Assessing external opportunities to conserve water: Most of the easily identifiable and executed water conservation opportunities at the site have been completed.
Water Stress,The Freeport team is completing a technological assessment to gain further understanding of external opportunities aided by basin diagnostics.
Water Stress,"One such effort involves understanding highly localized, scenario-based solutions for the basin's various water users - including farmers, governments and corporations."
Water Stress,"85% of source water is returned to the watershed at equal or better quality than at withdrawal, according to water-use assessments at Dow sites with the highest freshwater intake."
Water Stress,Dow appropriately treats and monitors the quality of water discharged back to the environment.
Water Stress,The total volume of treated wastewater discharged in 2020 was 119 million metric tons.
Water Stress,"Over many years, our wastewater intensity has been relatively consistent at approximately three pounds of wastewater discharged per pound of product."
Water Stress,The difference between water intake and water discharge is mainly due to evaporative losses associated with evaporative cooling practiced in locations to minimize water intake.
Water Stress,"Wastewater quality is strictly governed by local regulations, and parameters are set specifically for each watershed."
Water Stress,Dow's operations abide by these local regulations.
Water Stress,"Therefore, wastewater discharge quality is not reported consistently across all Dow sites."
Water Stress,"Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) are reported for the sites listed here, which account for more than 85% of Dow's wastewater discharge."
Water Stress,Our seven major wastewater discharge sites were identified to establish the baseline for the 2015 Sustainability Goals and account for more than 80% of our total discharge.
Water Stress,The six key water-stressed sites were added to the wastewater discharge quality reporting at the launch of the 2025 Sustainability Goal to reduce freshwater intake intensity at these sites by 20%.
Water Stress,"The TSS discharge concentration across the sites has been relatively consistent. (2016 TSS was 0.005%, and the BOD concentration was 0.004%.)"
Water Stress,"Dow is supporting efforts in water-stress basins through the Global Water Challenge ↗, a coalition of leading organizations committed to achieving universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene and women's empowerment."
Water Stress,We aim to reduce water usage in our operations by >5% from adjusted 2020 levels
Water Stress,Our goal is that at least 70% of our overall spending with suppliers will be devoted to those that have water reduction programs.
Water Stress,We plan to characterize the water usage of our value chain and regularly update it to reflect our value chain.
Water Stress,"Our ambition in this area includes integrating water stewardship principles, as defined by the United Nations Global Compact CEO Water Mandate, into our business models by 2050."
Water Stress,"By 2025, our goals are to reduce water usage in our operations by more than 5% from adjusted 2020 levels and ensure that at least 70% of our spending is with suppliers who have water reduction programs."
Water Stress,"In 2021, our operational water use was as follows:"
Water Stress,"In late 2021, we joined the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate, an initiative that mobilizes business leaders on water, sanitation, and the UN SDGs."
Water Stress,"As an endorser of the United Nations Global Compact CEO Water Mandate, we commit to continuous progress against six core elements of stewardship to understand and manage our own water risks: (1) Direct Operations (2) Supply Chain & Watershed Management (3) Collective Action (4) Public Policy (5) Community Engagement (6) Transparency."
Water Stress,"In Campinas, Brazil, 100% of the water we use for manufacturing is extracted from the Atibaia River."
Water Stress,"Since 1997, our Campinas plant has participated in the Reviva the Atibaia River environmental conservation project in partnership with the Jaguatibaia Environmental Protection Association and the Association of Remos de Sousas."
Water Stress,"In early 2021, we installed a purified water system that reduced water extraction by 23%."
Water Stress,"In total, these measures have reduced water extraction by up to 1,159 m3 per month."
Water Stress,"At our Pandaan facility in Indonesia, we installed bioporous holes as part of World Water Day in March 2022."
Water Stress,"These holes facilitate the decomposition of organic waste, help fertilize soil, reduce flooding, and recharge groundwater."
Water Stress,"And at our facility in Xochimilco, nearly 20% of the wastewater we generate is reused for irrigation of the grounds."
Water Stress,"At our production facility in Oss, we use purified water for our operations."
Water Stress,"In 2021, an external expert reviewed the purified water process in one of our biggest production buildings."
Water Stress,"As a result, we implemented two important improvements:"
Water Stress,"The amount of water that is drained is improved, and"
Water Stress,The system settings are improved and aligned better with our production process.
Water Stress,These improvements at Oss resulted in a water saving of 13 m3 /day. This is 4.1% of the total purchased water used at the site.
Water Stress,"The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design:"
Water Stress,Eliminate waste and pollution
Water Stress,Regenerate nature is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials.
Water Stress,"Our goal is that at least 80% of the operational waste at our six owned manufacturing sites will be reused, recycled, or otherwise used beneficially."
Water Stress,We aim to have 30% of our legacy packaging reviewed against the Sustainable Packaging guidelines to identify opportunities to reduce environmental impact.
Water Stress,"Water is a limited resource, and we seek to reduce its use in our operations."
Water Stress,The bulk of our water use stems from landscape irrigation and water consumption in our buildings.
Water Stress,"To manage our water use in the U.S., we monitor alerts in the utility bill-pay system that flags significant usage increases, enabling us to identify potential water leaks and work with the affected locations to ensure they are repaired."
Water Stress,This technology adjusts watering times based on weather conditions and lets us check our water use remotely.
Water Stress,Users can receive notifications about changes to the settings or equipment malfunctions.
Water Stress,"This automation saves water because the irrigation system runs less often, and it is easier to identify problems that could lead to excess water use."
Water Stress,"Water is essential for human activity, circulating around the planet while changing to and from solid, liquid and gaseous states."
Water Stress,"The remaining 2.5% is fresh water which supports human activity, including business activities."
Water Stress,"However, about three-quarters of that remaining fresh water exists in a frozen state such as within glaciers."
Water Stress,"Therefore, the amount of freshwater that is actually available for human use accounts for not even 1% of the Earth's total amount of water."
Water Stress,"Under the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world is striving to secure access to safe drinking water for all people, and through business activities and other economic initiatives, each country is also working to achieve more prosperous livelihoods, including access to water."
Water Stress,"Since economic scale and water consumption are closely correlated, companies must use water, one of the Earth's precious natural resources, in an efficient and appropriate manner while also aiming to solve challenges related to water issues through their businesses."
Water Stress,"The MC Group, which engages in a wide range of businesses worldwide, recognizes water as an essential element for its business activities and places critical importance on the sustainable use of water in all of its operations."
Water Stress,"In particular, MC identifies relevant risks and opportunities in a timely manner and, with the goal of achieving the sustainable use of water, establishes appropriate water consumption, recycling, reuse, and treatment throughout its operations and makes efforts to improve use efficiency and reduce consumption."
Water Stress,"Furthermore, MC will contribute to the resolution of global water issues by establishing water infrastructure businesses and developing comprehensive water operations that contribute to solving water issues."
Water Stress,"Aiming to reduce the consumption of limited water resources, for the fiscal year ended March 2022, MC has set a target to reduce water consumption at its Head Office compared to the consumption in the previous year."
Water Stress,"MC also conducts a sustainability survey which aims to track the withdrawals, discharges and recycling of water for the total operations of its portfolio investment companies."
Water Stress,"From a water resources perspective, MC has set up a screening process for decision-making that first confirms compliance with environmental regulations related to such factors as water discharge and withdrawals (confirmation of regulatory risks), as well as the impact of water withdrawals on surrounding communities, local society, biodiversity, and the impact of climate change on the fresh water environment (confirmation of physical risks)."
Water Stress,"For this screening process, particularly for businesses in areas considered to have high levels of water stress, MC utilizes the World Resource Institute (WRI) 's Aqueduct tool in order to incorporate external perspectives."
Water Stress,MC is involved in the copper mining business in Chile and Peru.
Water Stress,"Since copper mining requires a large amount of water, each mine is working on the implementation of technologies to maximize the water efficiency of operational processes in order to reduce new water intake."
Water Stress,"The Los Bronces Copper Mine (located in Chilean Metropolitan Region), in which MC invests together with Anglo American plc, achieved a water recycling rate of 85% in 2020 (+7% compared to 2019) as a result of increasing water recycling from tailings and procuring industrial wastewater and treated sewage water from third parties."
Water Stress,"The Escondida Copper Mine, one of MC's major investments, is located in the desert region of northern Chile and boasts the largest production volume in the world."
Water Stress,"At the minesite, water consumption is reduced in the ore processing phase through water-saving and reuse, among other means."
Water Stress,"Moreover, an investment, approximately US$4 billion to date, has been made in the construction of the desalination plant with one of the largest processing and pumping capacities in the world; the desalination plant has eliminated reliance on subterranean aquifers covering all the project's water requirements since the end of 2019."
Water Stress,"With water shortages due to drought becoming an issue for Chilean mines in recent years, we will continue to promote environmental protection and coexistence with local communities."
Water Stress,"Toyo Reizo Co., Ltd., one of MC's consolidated subsidiaries, has declared in its environmental policy that it will reduce the amount of water resources to be used in its production processes and will take preventative measures against the discharge of pollutants."
Water Stress,"It has also set targets to reduce water consumption on both a single fiscal year and mid-term basis, and engages in reduction activities."
Water Stress,"In particular, MC aims to reduce its environmental impact by saving water."
Water Stress,"To achieve this, it calculates consumption and discharge amounts in plants and related facilities with high water consumption for monthly assessment and review."
Water Stress,"In addition to these efforts to reduce water consumption, MC has also set targets for the reduction of CO2 and waste discharge and for the implementation rate of food waste recycling, etc. while seeking continual improvements though a PDCA cycle."
Water Stress,MC affiliate Olam International Limited committed in 2013 to reduce water consumption across its agricultural and manufacturing activities.
Water Stress,"As a specific example, a program in the US that produces onions with higher solid content and lower water content, combined with a focus on optimizing irrigation in collaboration with the growers, has achieved quantified savings of 27 billion liters of water consumption over the past decade."
Water Stress,"Recognizing the depletion of groundwater due to excessive pumping of water for agriculture and irrigation as a problem, in 2019, Olam's nut business in the US formed a partnership with the California Water Districts to replenish 1.2 billion liters of groundwater through three projects, and it is also pursuing initiatives such as maximizing the amount of water replenished during snowmelt."
Water Stress,"As a result, Olam achieved approximately 20% reduction in water consumption per ton in the fiscal year ended December 2020 compared to the previous year."
Water Stress,MC is delivering seawater desalination projects in drought regions of the world such as Atacama Desert in Chile and the State of Qatar in the Middle East which contribute to the alleviation of water stress in those regions.
Water Stress,"Northern Chile is facing serious depletion of groundwater, and alternative water sources are required in consideration of local communities and the agricultural industry."
Water Stress,MC provides a stable supply of desalted water to mines and farmlands in the region on the basis of a BOO (Build-Own-Operate) contract.
Water Stress,"In Qatar, MC is delivering an Independent Water and Power Project that supplies 2,520,000 kWh of electricity and 900,000 tons per day of water (which comprises 35% of Qatar's desalination capacity) to Qatar General Electricity & Water Corporation over 25 years."
Water Stress,MC is delivering the Project in cooperation with the Qatari government to fulfill growing demand for water associated with economic development and population growth and to contribute to the long-term development of the country.
Water Stress,"As living standards improve, global water consumption has increased dramatically, outpacing the rate of population growth and exacerbating water shortages in some regions."
Water Stress,"MC affiliate South Staffordshire Plc is a water company that supplies water to approximately 1.7 million people in the UK, as well as providing technical and retail services to other water, electricity and gas companies in a wide range of business areas."

Water Stress,"ESG Data marked with a star (⋆) for the year ended March 2021 has received independent practitioner's assurance from Deloitte Tohmatsu Sustainability Co., Ltd."
Water Stress,"Responsible resource management is an important part of our sustainability strategy, helping us reduce our impacts while improving efficiency and reducing costs."
Water Stress,"We are focused on reducing our water and waste footprint, along with appropriately managing the waste we generate."
Water Stress,We are focused on driving progress in the following areas:
Water Stress,"Conserving water. Our target is to reduce water use 20% by 2030, compared to a 2017 baseline."
Water Stress,"As of the end of 2021, we had reduced water use by over 5%."
Water Stress,"Across many of our corporate offices and branches, we have already deployed a number of water efficiency measures, including low-flow fixtures, aerators and touch-free faucets."
Water Stress,"To build on these efforts, we are working to install smart meters across our portfolio that will allow us to collect more accurate and timely water use data."
Water Stress,"This will help us better monitor and control our water use, and to identify and prioritize further efficiency opportunities."
Water Stress,"Set and meet contextbased water targets, where relevant and necessary"
Water Stress,Reduce operational* water intensity by 5% against 2020 baseline
Water Stress,Operational/Operations means manufacturing sites and distribution centers only.
Water Stress,"While our overall operations are not particularly water intensive, our employees and surrounding communities need sufficiently available fresh water to thrive."
Water Stress,We consider supporting sustainable water use to be a business imperative.
Water Stress,"In 2021, Stanley Black & Decker articulated an explicit Water Stewardship Policy."
Water Stress,"We aim to lead and initiate action-based projects with local communities, NGOs and water basin authorities where it matters most—the result of which will help to successfully fulfill our goal to create a more sustainable world."
Water Stress,"In 2021, our local manufacturing plant implemented five water reduction projects."
Water Stress,A leak prevention initiative saved 300 m3 water annually
Water Stress,Directly channeling water into a cooling tower reduced evaporation by 15 m3 annually.
Water Stress,Overflow sensors saved 15 m3 water.
Water Stress,These steps and more led to a total operational water withdrawal reduction of 330 m3 annually.
Water Stress,"In addition, Manesar installed sensor-based, efficient taps—saving 50 m3 —and began to collect runoff water, which reduced the facility's non-operational footprint by 25 m3 annually."
Water Stress,The combined water conservation efforts reduced Manesar's overall annual water footprint by 405 m3 .
Water Stress,"In locations with both significant baseline water stress and stress could result in a material risk to the business, we intend to monitor and set targets for:"
Water Stress,Percent of withdrawal in regions with high or extremely high baseline water stress
Water Stress,Percent of operations with context-based water targets set
Water Stress,"Percent of water consumption from water recycling/reuse or rainwater harvesting, where local conditions allow"
Water Stress,Our water stewardship journey continues to evolve.
Water Stress,"A year ago, we worked with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to help us move toward locally relevant contextual water targets, analyzing our global footprint for local water basin and operational water-related risks."
Water Stress,"We now focus on leading and initiating action-based projects with local communities, industry and water basin authorities."
Water Stress,"This focus on locally relevant water risk mitigation projects with context-based water targets is guided by internationally endorsed and agreed upon frameworks and goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Global Compact's CEO Water Mandate."
Water Stress,"Our detailed investigation into potential operational risks of our high profile sites with moderate to extremely high basin risk, using the WWF Water Risk Filter tool, verified that our operations mostly face low to medium direct waterrelated risk, due to limited water reliance of our operations and production processes."
Water Stress,Confirming that our direct risk is limited underscores the necessary transformation from general intensity focus to a location-specific approach customized to the unique water basin risk impact.
Water Stress,"Guided by this physical water stress analysis on scarcity, flooding, water quality risk and the like, we investigated the local water scarcity risk of 24 manufacturing and distribution sites with indicated elevated risk levels."
Water Stress,"The sites are not at immediate risk as local authorities have installed infrastructure (e.g., reservoirs and technical processes such as desalination) to counter the basin stress."
Water Stress,"In 2021, we implemented a total of 28 water-focused projects."
Water Stress,"Of those, seven were process focused to increase water management efficiency to increase water management efficiency in the plating process, improve recycling and reuse for cooling/reconditioning and increase water management control with automated meters."
Water Stress,"The other 21 projects focused on non-process water management, such as automated faucets in washrooms and rainwater harvesting for sanitary use and landscaping."
Water Stress,We plan to continue to monitor and work with our sites locally to investigate potential flood and water quality risks and improvement opportunities in 2022.
Water Stress,Water is essential to every person and every ecosystem in the world; it is also essential to the products we make and the agricultural ingredients we use.
Water Stress,"Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security through a context-based approach to water replenishment, advocacy for smart water policies and responsible water use across our operations and supply chain."
Water Stress,"We're using the size and scale of our company to improve water security where water risks impact our business, supply chain and communities."
Water Stress,167% of the water used in our finished beverages returned to nature and communities in 2021
Water Stress,"18.5M+ people provided access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene since 2010"
Water Stress,"Peer-reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit; calculated benefits per project and operating unit using peer-reviewed methodologies; all replenish data are internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (175 Billion Liters; BL) is externally assured; Benefits fall into three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (229.1 BL), Water for Productive Use (47.5 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (16.7 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities between 2019 - 2021, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume."
Water Stress,Calculated with self-reported and internally validated data
Water Stress,"Our 2030 Water Security Strategy outlines a vision of increasing water security for our operations, watersheds and communities."
Water Stress,"Water security is defined as the availability of a sufficient quantity and quality of water, access to safe water services and effective governance of shared water resources."
Water Stress,It is underpinned by global goals and specific contextbased targets that will enable us to measure our progress toward reaching this vision.
Water Stress,"Our global goals for 2030 fall under three pillars with one cross-cutting goal, maintaining at least 100% global replenishment of the water used in our finished beverages:"
Water Stress,"In 2020 and 2021, we analyzed water-related risks to identify priority operating facilities, which allows us to segment our operations into three categories: Leadership Locations, Advanced Efficiency Locations and Contributing Locations."
Water Stress,"We catalogued these locations based on the detailed mapping and results from an Enterprise Water Risk Assessment (EWRA) from the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct 3.0 tool and from Facility Water Vulnerability Assessments (FAWVA), our site-level, internal proprietary tool."
Water Stress,LEADERSHIP LOCATIONS: our highest priority system facility locations and their correlated watersheds that have the highest potential water-related risks.
Water Stress,Facilities are on a path toward 100% regenerative water use by 2030.
Water Stress,See next page for more on regenerative water use.
Water Stress,ADVANCED EFFICIENCY LOCATIONS: system facility locations in a water-stressed2 context that will drive advanced water efficiency improvements in operations.
Water Stress,CONTRIBUTING LOCATIONS: system facility locations in areas with potential low water-related risks yet will contribute to water security overall by meeting 100% compliance with global Coca-Cola Company water stewardship requirements.
Water Stress,We are mapping priority ingredient sourcing regions and watersheds according to highest exposure to water stress.
Water Stress,"We also began mapping priority communities based on local context to identify opportunities for action to strengthen communities' access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and their resilience to climate change (e.g., floods and droughts)."
Water Stress,"By mapping and overlaying all three of these categories (operations, watersheds and communities), we will identify overlaps and interconnectivity across our action areas to develop a holistic, integrated and context-based approach."
Water Stress,"Refers to ""high"" or ""extremely high"" water stress. Water stress measures the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies."
Water Stress,"Following the process to identify and segment our priority operating facilities, we are now setting local, context-based targets1 for these facilities to contribute to the achievement of our 2030 targets for this pillar, which include:"
Water Stress,100% regenerative water use in all Leadership Locations
Water Stress,Drive advanced water efficiency improvements in water-stressed contexts.

Water Stress,"Installation of handwashing facilities and water connections for communities in the Philippines to help respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, benefiting over 200,000 people"
Water Stress,"Our 2030 Water Security Strategy builds on this work, seeking to improve access to water and sanitation and strengthen community resilience."
Water Stress,"We're focused on projects that will support and empower women and girls who, in many parts of the world, bear most of the responsibility for fetching water and running households."
Water Stress,"As outlined in the Risk Assessments and Prioritization section, we are identifying our priority operational, commercial and sourcing communities."
Water Stress,We are using a set of criteria from leading global institutions specializing in water and health.
Water Stress,We aim to support all our priority communities in addressing shared water challenges by identifying and implementing interventions focused on three primary action areas:
Water Stress,"Improving access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene"
Water Stress,Enabling adaptation to water-related climate change impacts
Water Stress,Ensuring rapid recovery from crises.
Water Stress,These actions will contribute to the achievement of our 2030 Water Security Strategy targets:
Water Stress,Support access to WASH initiatives in all our priority communities
Water Stress,Promote access to WASH throughout our bottling system and priority suppliers.
Water Stress,Clean water is only one piece of the water resilience puzzle.
Water Stress,"To achieve the greatest health and economic benefits, improvements in sanitation and hygiene must be prioritized alongside access to clean water."
Water Stress,We recognize our business operates in areas with significant challenges to water access and sanitation.
Water Stress,"This is one reason why sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene—particularly for women and girls—is specifically addressed in our 2030 strategy."
Water Stress,We're collaborating with international organizations and coalitions such as WaterAid and Global Water Challenge to understand and meet the needs of women and girls and to systemically embed and measure gender-related outcomes of community WASH programs.
Water Stress,This work will build on the groundbreaking findings of the 2018 Ripple Effect Study—which quantified the significant impact of WASH improvements on women's empowerment— and draw on learnings from the successful Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) and our 5by20® economic empowerment initiative.
Water Stress,"Since 2010, our RAIN initiative has reached more than 6.7 million people in 41 countries and territories in Africa with safe, sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene, impacting more than 4,000 communities."
Water Stress,"""In communities where water is scarce, women and girls are responsible for the grueling task of collecting water, resulting in missed opportunities for learning, generating income and pursuing a brighter future."
Water Stress,"We're proud to work with The Coca-Cola Company to drive change through the power of clean water and to involve women every step of the way to ensure inclusive, long-term solutions to the world's most pressing problems."
Water Stress,"In Latin America, we're launching a new program, Aliados por el Agua (Allies for Water), across 18 countries that will mobilize collective action to improve critical access to water, sanitation and hygiene in vulnerable and water-stressed communities and key watersheds."
Water Stress,"The program, which aims to benefit an estimated 2 million people by 2030, will replicate best practices from a program that we have supported for more than a decade in Africa."

Water Stress,"As outlined earlier in this section, in 2020, we began analyzing and prioritizing our operational, commercial and ingredient sourcing watersheds."
Water Stress,"Over the past year, we have developed a Watershed Health Framework to provide our operations with help to assess watersheds' challenges and risks, and implement context-based Watershed Stewardship Plans."
Water Stress,Watershed risks vary from location to location.
Water Stress,"For some, water availability may be the primary risk; for others, it might be water quality, water access, soil health or forest fires, to name a few."
Water Stress,"By adopting a context-based approach, we aim to support interventions relevant to our priority watersheds."
Water Stress,This work at the local watershed level will contribute to the achievement of our 2030 high level targets:
Water Stress,Implement watershed stewardship plans in all of our priority watersheds.
Water Stress,Promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in waterstressed regions.

Community Relations,"Walmart's disaster preparedness and management efforts are part of the company's Global Security Program, a risk-based approach to protecting our people, facilities, information, supply chain and inventory."
Community Relations,The approach includes emergency management standards and business continuity practices.
Community Relations,Our intention is to enable and empower associates with the resources to effectively prepare for and manage disasters and disruptions.
Community Relations,Walmart's Emergency Management department (a team of emergency management experts from across our business) oversees disaster preparation and recovery efforts.
Community Relations,"The department is responsible for identifying, assessing and responding to events such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks and other crises."
Community Relations,The department includes:
Community Relations,Emergency Operation Center (EOC): The EOC serves as the central command center for preparation and response activity
Community Relations,"The EOC operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
Community Relations,"Business Continuity Team: This team is responsible for the company's business resiliency efforts, working with critical business functions and partnering with IT Disaster Recovery teams to ensure plans and strategies are in place to prepare the company for significant business disruptions and enable it to resume operations quickly."
Community Relations,"Senior executives oversee our disaster preparation and response efforts, including through the following groups:"
Community Relations,Executive Council: Senior executives that comprise the Council oversee our disaster efforts and are notified any time the EOC is activated to respond to crisis situations.
Community Relations,Corporate Crisis Management Team (CCMT): CCMT was created in FY2021 as an advisory body comprised of corporate functional officers for enterprise-wide emergency planning and response policy efforts.
Community Relations,"Emergency Support Functions (ESF): Adapted from FEMA's National Response Framework, Walmart groups decision makers, responders and resources into Emergency Support Functions."
Community Relations,"These ESFs, which include associates from our People, Operations, and Walmart.org80 teams, work together to ensure an effective and consistent response from the company."
Community Relations,"Walmart associates receive role-specific training in business continuity policies and practices, including participating in preparedness exercises."
Community Relations,Associates are responsible for understanding their roles and requirements related to business continuity and emergency management.
Community Relations,"Our disaster planning and preparedness includes risk assessments, business continuity planning, and training."
Community Relations,"We use data to identify, assess and help manage risks related to weather, environmental, public health and security events."
Community Relations,"When California wildfires severely impacted local air quality, we used real-time data about local air quality to notify associates working outdoors to wear N95 masks in accordance with state law."
Community Relations,"Working with our Compliance and Operations teams, we added open-source air quality information to the EOC's dashboard, a site on Walmart's associate-facing website where associates can quickly check the status of events and find resources."
Community Relations,"When air quality reached the threshold, local associates received a notification from the EOC telling them to wear a mask."
Community Relations,"With the 2020 hurricane season predicted to be extremely active, the Walmart.org80 team worked with the Salvation Army and Feeding America to pre-stage product near coastal areas to reduce response time."
Community Relations,"Water, snacks and essential items were shipped by Walmart to staging areas weeks in advance of the hurricane season so that these organizations were prepared to respond more quickly helping those affected by storms."
Community Relations,Walmart business units and corporate functions have business continuity and crisis plans to guide recovery in the event of an emergency.
Community Relations,"In FY2021, the Enterprise Business Continuity team trained over 1,000 associates on how to maintain their plans and leverage business continuity strategies."
Community Relations,The team also created 187 new business continuity plans throughout FY2021.
Community Relations,The Walmart Foundation has also helped to support disaster preparedness in communities.
Community Relations,"For example, in 2019, the Foundation provided a grant to the St. Bernard Project (SBP) to support SBP's Leader Practitioner Course. The course is designed to train government leaders in developing and implementing long-term strategies for community disaster recovery and mitigation."
Community Relations,"When disasters occur, the Walmart EOC provides real-time support, through a variety of channels including an emergency phone line and an emergency app."
Community Relations,"Our Global Emergency Management team works with our facility and human resources teams to help ensure our associates and families are safe. Through OneWalmart.com, our associate-facing website, we provide recommendations and best practices for what to do before, during and after a natural disaster or when a store experiences a security threat or other business disruptions."
Community Relations,Personal and work preparedness plans and kits are available for download as well as resources to help associates affected by a disaster.
Community Relations,"For example, Walmart provides disaster displacement assistance for those forced to leave their homes due to a federally declared disaster, as well as opportunities to work in nearby stores and clubs should their location temporarily close."
Community Relations,Information on this line is automatically updated and is tailored to the caller's work location.
Community Relations,"Also, the hotline allows associates to provide Walmart with their contact information and the ability to request assistance."
Community Relations,"To help manage our disaster response and recovery, we set up temporary inbound and outbound call centers to check in with our associates to make sure they are safe."
Community Relations,"Additionally, we deploy associates and resources such as food and other products, mobile generators, mobile pharmacies, and fuel resources."
Community Relations,"We use technology and support initiatives that help improve the speed and focus of disaster response so that people, food, water and other resources are quickly deployed to the right places (see discussion regarding use of data customer above)."
Community Relations,"After each event, the Emergency Management team conducts after-action reviews to incorporate lessons learned for continuous improvement."
Community Relations,"While Walmart has long helped communities in times of disaster, the experience of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 helped us realize how we best draw on our strengths to support relief efforts in the aftermath of disaster."
Community Relations,The primary way we support communities in times of disaster is by operating our business.
Community Relations,"We work to reopen stores as quickly and safely as possible so that people can access the pharmacy, grocery and other essential products and services."
Community Relations,Customers can see which stores are open and available for their needs on our corporate website.
Community Relations,"The Walmart.org80 team and the Public-Private team in Walmart's Emergency Management Department work with response organizations who are on the ground in hard-hit communities, relaying real-time information back to our EOC."
Community Relations,"We use this information to determine the level and nature of support needed, which can range from product donations (such as food and water) to major grants to relief organizations and community foundations."
Community Relations,"Since 2016, Walmart, Sam's Club and the Walmart Foundation have provided more than $108 million in cash and in-kind donations to support community preparedness and relief efforts for disasters including COVID-19."
Community Relations,"For example, our support in FY2021 included:"
Community Relations,"Central America fell victim to Hurricanes Iota and Eta in late 2020, and Walmart and the Walmart Foundation responded with a commitment of up to $1 million through the Walmart Foundation Disaster Relief Fund at Charities Aid Foundation of America, a donor advised fund."
Community Relations,Our stores in Central America were also engaged with emergency efforts and supported organizations that helped those affected by the storm.
Community Relations,"While responding in the moment is important, we also aim to help communities build resiliency and respond more quickly and effectively when disaster strikes."
Community Relations,"In 2019, additional funding was provided to launch the Partner Hub, which uses the RC View platform."
Community Relations,"While we use available data to prepare for and predict storms and other disruptions, these events are inherently unpredictable."
Community Relations,"Moreover, storm intensity, frequency and unpredictability are expected to increase with climate change."
Community Relations,The primary way we serve communities is by operating our business; our success in serving communities in times of disaster and disruption is therefore dependent on our ability to keep operating and/or resume operations.
Community Relations,"Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities, as discussed in more detail in Walmart's most recent annual report on Form 10-K."
Community Relations,"Successfully serving communities and recovering from disasters and disruptions are dependent on engagement of associates, suppliers, and customers."
Community Relations,"Associates serve our customers, suppliers produce and distribute products, and customers contribute to relief efforts."
Community Relations,The Company's Human Rights policy communicates its respect for human rights in all that it does and how it extends those rights to employees and business partners.
Community Relations,"As a signatory of the United Nations (U.N.) Global Compact, the Company's practice is to uphold and support the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. The Company does not permit the use of child labor, forced labor or coercion, including physical punishment, in any of its operations."
Community Relations,The Company is committed to abiding by the following practices:
Community Relations,Conduct business in accordance with the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights and the principles of the U.N. Global Compact and extend those requirements to all suppliers doing business with the Company.
Community Relations,"Provide access to grievance mechanisms, investigate allegations, and escalate known cases of human rights abuse to senior leadership."
Community Relations,Integrate training and accountability for respecting human rights across the business and the supply chain.
Community Relations,Engage internal and external stakeholders to address common challenges and advance human rights practices through continuous improvement.
Community Relations,Operate legally and ethically in each country where it does business.
Community Relations,"The Company's corporate strategies, practices, and guidelines as well as supplier requirements must support this commitment to human rights."
Community Relations,We are a global company with a complex value chain that spans multiple tiers and hundreds of countries and territories.
Community Relations,"A robust management approach is required to prevent, identify, and address potential human rights impacts."
Community Relations,"With this approach as our foundation, we prioritize our efforts by focusing on our salient human rights issues - the human rights at risk of the most severe negative impact through our company activities and business relationships."
Community Relations,This process helps ensure that we have the appropriate policies and procedures in place to help prevent and address potential human rights risks across our value chain.
Community Relations,"We also work on a variety of additional issues (e.g., Climate Change, Privacy, Nutrition, Added Sugar and Sodium Reduction) through our broader Sustainability Agenda."
Community Relations,We closely monitor emerging issues and regularly review our salient issues to ensure alignment with emerging best practices and external stakeholder feedback.
Community Relations,We believe that strong governance is essential to successfully embedding respect for human rights throughout our business.
Community Relations,"Our global governance structure is responsible for overseeing and managing human rights at various levels throughout our business, with our Board of Directors, Executive Committee, and Chief Human Rights Officer serving central oversight and management roles."
Community Relations,Freedom of association refers to the right of all workers to join or form a legally recognized trade union or any other organization.
Community Relations,"While freedom of association is a fundamental right enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, there are still a variety of challenges in ensuring that it is consistently respected around the world - from interference with the rights of workers to legal restrictions on the right of association."
Community Relations,"We respect the right of freedom of association, and this principle is embodied in our Global Code of Conduct, Global Human Rights Workplace Policy, and Global Supplier Code of Conduct."
Community Relations,"This means that, consistent with local laws, associates have the right to assemble, communicate, join associations of their choice."
Community Relations,PepsiCo fully complies with all laws regulating collective bargaining.
Community Relations,"In 2020, approximately 51 percent of employees worldwide, eligible to be covered under collective bargaining agreements, were represented."
Community Relations,PepsiCo maintains positive working relationships with union representatives.
Community Relations,Water is fundamental to the global food system and to our business.
Community Relations,"It nourishes the crops used to make our products, serves as the main ingredient in many of our beverages, and is an integral component of our manufacturing operations."
Community Relations,"But in some regions, water is scarce."
Community Relations,"Climate change is also worsening pressures on water resources around the world, with current estimates indicating that two-thirds of the world's population will live in water-stressed regions by 2025."
Community Relations,"Secure land rights are a vital component of economic prosperity, sustainable food production, and the responsible use of natural resources."
Community Relations,"This can be particularly true in developing countries and areas inhabited by indigenous communities, yet current estimates indicate that only 30 percent of the world's population has a legally registered title to their land."
Community Relations,"Land rights issues have the potential to directly impact local communities and the daily lives of rights holders, such as through physical displacement or the loss of economic opportunity."
Community Relations,"The terms ""vulnerable workers"" and ""vulnerable worker groups"" are generally used to refer to a specific set of workers that are at a higher risk of experiencing potential adverse human rights impacts."
Community Relations,"The underlying reason for their vulnerability can be the result of a variety of factors such as their location, industry, or employment conditions."
Community Relations,"Recognizing the scale of our value chain and the inherent complexities involved in global agricultural supply chains, we identified vulnerable workers as one of our salient human rights issues during our last review."
Community Relations,"Through internal assessments and consultations with external experts and stakeholders, we determined that migrant workers, women, young workers, and temporary/contract workers were the groups with a higher risk of potentially experiencing adverse human rights impacts across our value chain."
Community Relations,"Given the complexities of the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, workers in these industries are at a higher risk of facing potential adverse human rights impacts related to working hours and wages, such as excessive working hours, lack of adequate rest periods, and compulsory overtime. We are committed to providing fair and equitable wages, benefits, and other employment conditions in accordance with local law, and we expect the same of our suppliers and business partners throughout our value chain. Supporting the health, safety, and well-being of workers throughout our value chain is one of our top priorities as a company."
Community Relations,We have established a number of policies and programs to help drive health and safety values throughout our direct operations and supply chain.
Community Relations,"We participate in a variety of multi-stakeholder groups and collaborative initiatives to enhance our knowledge of specific issues, drive industry-wide progress, and help address systemic challenges facing our industry."
Community Relations,"Several of these groups include AIM-PROGRESS, the Sedex Stakeholder Forum, the Consumer Goods Forum, and the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment."
Community Relations,"At Apple, we are committed to leaving the world better than we found it. That means supporting communities globally with initiatives that combat inequity and expand access to opportunity."
Community Relations,"Through efforts that address racial equity and justice, education, affordable housing, and more, we foster open communication with local community partners and stakeholders to understand dynamic challenges in order to drive meaningful impact."
Community Relations,We have an urgent responsibility to help dismantle systemic racism and support opportunities for communities of color.
Community Relations,"Our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), launched in June 2020 and beginning in the United States, focuses on creating lasting change in three areas: expanding access to education, supporting criminal justice reform, and removing economic barriers for Black and Brown communities."
Community Relations,"Starting with a $100 million commitment, this initiative has spurred new partnerships and projects while inspiring us to weave a focus on equity and justice into everything we do."
Community Relations,REJI builds on our long-standing commitment to education.
Community Relations,"We're partnering with schools in under-resourced communities to enrich their science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs, and to support educators and learners with Apple technology, curriculum, and hands-on professional learning."
Community Relations,"To deepen our engagement with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the U.S., Apple helped launch the Propel Center, a global innovation and learning hub in Atlanta, Georgia, that offers innovation curricula, technology support, career opportunities, and fellowship programs."
Community Relations,"In addition, we are deepening and expanding our work with new innovation grants for HBCU engineering programs, a Fellows program for educators, and academic scholarships."
Community Relations,We support organizations that continue to challenge a justice system that disproportionately fails Black and Brown people.
Community Relations,"These include the Equal Justice Initiative, Leadership Conference Education Fund, the King Center, and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute."
Community Relations,"Black founders and developers in the technology sector face systemic barriers, especially when starting and leading companies."
Community Relations,"Programs like our Entrepreneur Camp for Black Founders and Developers give app founders and developers guidance and support from Apple experts so they can take their app experience to the next level. We're also partnering with Michigan State University to open an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, a city with a vibrant Black entrepreneur and developer community and over 50,000 minority-owned businesses."
Community Relations,"Our work to promote Black and Brown businesses extends to our own business activities, where we are increasing Apple's spend with diverse suppliers. Read more in Using our purchasing power for good (p43)."
Community Relations,"In January 2021, we announced two financial commitments to support Black and Brown entrepreneurs."
Community Relations,"And Apple is investing $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank's Clear Vision Impact Fund, increasing loan capital for small- and medium-sized minority-owned businesses and underserved communities."
Community Relations,"In May 2021, building on these two commitments, we supported VamosVentures, a Latinx-owned fund investing in technology-enabled companies led by Latinx and diverse founders, and Collab Capital, which aims to decrease the racial wealth gap by helping Black-founded businesses overcome the funding and network challenges that often stifle their growth."
Community Relations,"To ensure that our work to protect the planet also enhances equity, we launched an Impact Accelerator for Black- and Brown-owned businesses."
Community Relations,Read more about Apple's Impact Accelerator (p9).
Community Relations,"We believe access to education is a human right, and that everyone has their own way of learning and expressing themselves. We work hard to ensure our resources are used to uplift communities around the world, creating opportunities for educators and students to gain coding skills and unlock creativity."
Community Relations,"Through educational partnerships across the U.S., we've been able to reach tens of thousands of students and educators who might not have had access to our technology and education tools."
Community Relations,"CEI partners with K-12 and higher education institutions, community-based organizations, and nonprofits to bring coding, creativity, and workforce development opportunities to educators and learners of all ages."
Community Relations,"CEI aims to build knowledge and skills for high-demand, high-growth technical careers alongside communities of color to advance educational equity."
Community Relations,"Our support includes hardware grants, monetary grants to support scholarships and programming, resources for educator training, curriculum development, and employee engagement opportunities."
Community Relations,"After starting with 10 communities in 2019, we are now working in dozens of locations around the U.S.—including with 36 HBCUs—to create more coding, creativity, and other learning opportunities. Grounded in the positive relationships that we have created, we are working to deepen our impact in three areas:"
Community Relations,"We're providing educator development and training opportunities to build the knowledge and skills educators need to teach coding in underrepresented communities through Teacher Coding Academies and the CEI Learning Series, in which hundreds of teachers from around the U.S. can meet virtually to share best practices on remote learning."
Community Relations,"Through our Academies and CEI Learning Series, we are connecting CEI educators with Apple Distinguished Educators from all around the world."
Community Relations,"Apple Distinguished Educators lead and participate in learning workshops, along with our Apple Professional Learning Specialists."
Community Relations,"We're especially focused on expanding our engagement with minority-serving institutions, including HBCUs, HSIs, and tribal colleges and universities, as well as community colleges and public schools in underserved communities."
Community Relations,"As the app economy continues to grow, we're investing in educational programs and opportunities that prepare learners of all ages for the jobs of the future."
Community Relations,"The Apple Developer Academy partners with educational institutions to create an immersive 10- to 12-month program that enables up-and-coming developers to apply the latest technologies, build their businesses, and market their ideas globally."
Community Relations,"In 2013, we started the Apple Developer Academy to empower entrepreneurs, creators, and coders by helping them cultivate the skills necessary to pursue new career opportunities. The program focuses on communities with high youth unemployment and is open to anyone, regardless of academic background or experience. The program also seeks to attract women to software development, a field where they're grossly underrepresented."
Community Relations,"In seven years, participation among women in the Apple Developer Academy has grown from 6 to 36 percent."
Community Relations,"Currently available in several countries, Apple Developer Academy consists of:"
Community Relations,A 30-day introductory program designed for learners considering app economy careers and looking to better understand what it means to be a developer.
Community Relations,"This program plays a critical role in sparking interest among the next generation of developers and bringing diverse representation to the growing app ecosystem, particularly among women and individuals from underrepresented communities."
Community Relations,An intensive 10- to 12-month program that helps aspiring developers build the skills needed to participate in opportunities within the app economy and even start their own businesses.
Community Relations,"In addition to partnering with institutions, the Academy works closely with employers to provide direct pathways to career opportunities."
Community Relations,Our 22 Foundation Programs and 17 Academies include close collaborations with institutions that provide content and experience opportunities.
Community Relations,Research shows that female and Black business founders and leaders face specific challenges in the technology sector.
Community Relations,"That's why we created Apple Entrepreneur Camp, an immersive tech lab for app-driven companies founded and led by developers from underrepresented backgrounds. The camp offers one-on-one guidance from Apple experts and engineers, mentorship from Apple leaders, and ongoing support through a growing alumni community."
Community Relations,"Apple held its first-ever Entrepreneur Camp in 2019 with a class of women founders and developers. As part of our ongoing commitment to dismantle barriers to opportunity, in early 2021 we welcomed leaders and their teams from 13 app companies as the inaugural cohort of our Entrepreneur Camp for Black Founders and Developers."
Community Relations,"Through our Affordable Housing Initiative, announced in 2019, we have made a comprehensive $2.5 billion commitment to address the housing availability and affordability crisis in California."

Community Relations,"Many of the new units are reserved for veterans, the homeless or formerly homeless, and residents with developmental disabilities."
Community Relations,We invest in communities through donations to nonprofit organizations as well as through strategic investments.
Community Relations,"Over the past three years, we've committed over $3 billion toward donations and values-focused investments such as our Affordable Housing Initiative, REJI, clean energy investments, and the Apple Restore Fund."
Community Relations,"We see an important opportunity to continue to invest our capital for good. While donations and investments are accounted for separately, we undertake both with one common goal: to create meaningful change in communities around the world."
Community Relations,Our corporate donations seek to accelerate social change by supporting organizations that are addressing society's toughest problems. We empower employees to contribute to the causes they care about by amplifying their efforts through matching their donations.
Community Relations,"Our swift response to the COVID-19 crisis, which included over $120 million23 in donations, is a reflection of our commitment to being a source of relief and recovery in the face of global challenges."
Community Relations,"Since fiscal year 2015, Apple has donated over $1 billion24 to create positive change in communities across the globe."
Community Relations,"Whether it's racial injustice, food insecurity, a natural disaster, or a health emergency, our community giving program is agile enough to allow us to respond in a timely, efficient, and effective way."
Community Relations,We have designed our corporate donations to address immediate needs and to build community resilience.

Community Relations,"Since 2006, Apple-supported grants have provided over 10.8 million people with care and support services, helped distribute more than 167 million HIV tests, and provided 13.8 million people with ongoing access to life-saving antiretroviral treatment. COVID-19 has created challenges in accessing care, diagnostics, and supplies, often disrupting crucial HIV/ AIDS programs."
Community Relations,"At the onset of the pandemic, contributions to (RED) were redirected to the Global Fund's COVID-19 Response to help alleviate the impact of the virus on the communities most affected by HIV/AIDS and provide critical support in health systems threatened by the outbreak."
Community Relations,We focus our donations on programs that are building strong communities and empowering creatives in the places where we live and work.
Community Relations,"Over the past several years, Apple has offered more than 70 small grants across 12 countries—broadening our impact and bolstering essential community work around the world."

Community Relations,"In 2019, 96% of employees at overseas production subsidiaries and 100% of employees in South Korea completed training programs."
Community Relations,"In cooperation with external stakeholders, we provided special training on protecting vulnerable groups such as migrant workers."
Community Relations,"In 2020, we will launch a new developed labor and human rights training program in collaboration with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) for all our employees, including those in production worker, supervisors, and management."
Community Relations,"This training contains different content according to employee job position and function, but all programs aim to address all labor and human rights topics including what labor and human rights employees naturally have, why labor and human rights matter to business, what our company's and employees' responsibilities are for respecting labor and human rights, and how to bring labor and human rights into practice."
Community Relations,"In Malaysia and Hungary, together with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), we trained our human resource personnel, as well as those from our suppliers and recruitment agencies, on the ethical recruitment of migrant workers."

Community Relations,"Our worksite monitoring system supports the enforcement of labor and human rights and compliance management in areas such as working environment, workplace culture, operation of representative bodies, and management of suppliers."
Community Relations,"The system, provided in 12 languages, including English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Spanish, evaluates 55 items in seven areas1) every year, and is instrumental in identifying worksites that need in-house expert consultation to strengthen capacity and make improvements."
Community Relations,We listen to our employees and understand their needs and concerns about labor and human rights through a variety of communication channels.
Community Relations,"In 2019, for example, we held 30 top management-led Townhall meetings, which were attended by 14,260 employees1) in South Korea."
Community Relations,Attendants were informed of business updates and participated in a question and answer session with the management on various agenda including work environment and benefits.
Community Relations,"Outside of South Korea, heads of subsidiaries hosted 236 similar sessions, where 77,329 employees attended."
Community Relations,"In addition, we encourage our department heads to meet frequently with team members to discuss matters related to their work relationships and career development."
Community Relations,"To do this, we engage in regular dialogue with governments, academia and civil society."
Community Relations,We periodically evaluate the level of labor and human rights compliance and monitor improvement activities.
Community Relations,Every year we use our workplace monitoring system to identify those worksites which are considered high-risk and then conduct a detailed analysis of each of them.
Community Relations,"In 2019, we performed assessments in six locations, including two in Southeast Asia and one in Europe."
Community Relations,"As a result, a total of 99 tasks that required improvements were identified, of which 82 tasks (82.8%) were completed."
Community Relations,"As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we apply their Code of Conduct across our businesses and our supply chain."
Community Relations,"We use the RBA on-site audit protocols to identify the working environment risks in labor, health and safety, environment, business ethics, and management system so we can implement corrective action plans."

Community Relations,"In a disaster, these experts focus on removing obstacles, and ensuring coordination and efficiency."
Community Relations,"McKesson has a robust business continuity program designed to help the company continue to serve employees, communities, customers and their patients."
Community Relations,"McKesson takes an ""all risk"" (loss of people, technology, facility or supplier) approach to resilience, and prepares for both macro-level risks, such as a massive natural disaster or pandemic, and micro-level risks, such as localized severe weather."
Community Relations,"The Global Security Operations Center (GSOC) supports McKesson's response to a major incident or crisis by collecting, analyzing and delivering data on global risks that may impact McKesson employees, facilities, operations or reputation."

Community Relations,"The McKesson Taking Care of Our Own Fund, administered by the Emergency Assistance Foundation, provides cash grants for employees experiencing personal hardship or the effects of a qualified disaster.

Community Relations,"For example, in collaboration with the Sutton Trust, in 2021 our Firm launched a more than £4.8 million endowment fund to improve access to employment opportunities for underserved, low-income and Black and Minority Ethnic university students in the U.K., starting with 350 students in the next 10 years."
Community Relations,"Managed at no cost by J.P. Morgan Private Bank, the endowment will provide students with scholarships to help them access enrichment opportunities, such as internships, study abroad programs, volunteering experiences and additional courses and training, that contribute to positive employability outcomes."
Community Relations,"Alongside our financial support, a key focus of our employee volunteerism efforts around the world is supporting youth to prepare for future careers."
Community Relations,"Approximately one in three working age adults in the U.S. has a criminal record, and as a result face economic barriers including hiring discrimination and lost job opportunities."
Community Relations,This affects individuals and their families and also has broader economic consequences that contribute to inequality.
Community Relations,"Black adults are nearly six times more likely to be incarcerated than White adults, and Latino adults are more than three times more likely, meaning the Black and Latino communities disproportionately bear the consequences."
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase is giving people with criminal records a second chance by supporting their participation in the workforce, communities and local economies."
Community Relations,"We are making changes in our own hiring and recruitment practices, along with advancing a policy agenda that reduces barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds."
Community Relations,"In addition, we are supporting community organizations that equip people with criminal backgrounds with the skills, resources and connections to get on a career pathway."
Community Relations,"For example, in 2021 we committed $12.5 million to help community organizations in cities like Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Nashville and Wilmington connect people with criminal backgrounds with in-demand, well-paying jobs and other tools to achieve their financial goals."
Community Relations,We have taken a number of steps to broaden our potential talent pool and create more inclusive inroads to careers at our Firm by actively working to reduce barriers to employment for individuals with criminal backgrounds.
Community Relations,"We started in 2018 with the decision to ""ban the box"" by removing all questions about criminal backgrounds from our job applications in the U.S."
Community Relations,"Next, we developed a program to work with community and legal aid organizations to proactively develop a pipeline of potential employees with criminal backgrounds, whose histories fit within industry guidelines, to fill open roles."
Community Relations,"In 2019, we piloted this Second Chance community-based hiring program in Chicago and, in 2021, we expanded the model to Columbus, Ohio, with plans to bring it to additional cities."
Community Relations,"Through the program, we collaborate with local nonprofit organizations, which provide job seekers with mentorship and training to prepare them for employment opportunities."
Community Relations,"Our recruiters coordinate directly with the nonprofit to identify open roles and potential candidates, who are then connected with hiring managers within our Firm."
Community Relations,"Through these and other efforts, we hired approximately 4,000 individuals with criminal backgrounds in 2021, approximately 10% of our new hires in the U.S."
Community Relations,"Through the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter, our Firm is developing and advancing sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions to help remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds."
Community Relations,Our efforts are focused on supporting:
Community Relations,"Reforms to industry hiring rules by working with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"") and Congress to support efforts to modify Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act rules for people with convictions for certain low-risk crimes to qualify for jobs in the banking industry."
Community Relations,"Clean Slate automatic record clearing measures in states across the country and the Clean Slate Act of 2021, which would allow certain federal records to be sealed."
Community Relations,"The Firm has supported Clean Slate legislation to help clear or seal eligible criminal records and open access to jobs in places such as Michigan, Delaware, Connecticut and Virginia - and continues to push for measures in New York and Colorado."
Community Relations,"The Fair Chance Act, which was signed into federal law in December 2019 and helps qualified workers with arrest or conviction records compete for employment in federal agencies and with federal contractors."
Community Relations,Restoration of access to Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals.
Community Relations,"Signed into federal law in 2020, the Restoring Education and Learning Act allows incarcerated individuals to pursue post-secondary education in prison, increasing employment opportunities after their release."
Community Relations,The federal Driving for Opportunity Act and state measures which seek to limit driver's license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees unrelated to driving infractions.
Community Relations,"Business, particularly small- and medium-size enterprises, serves as a key engine of economic growth and mobility, especially in low- and moderate-income communities."
Community Relations,"However, minority- and women-owned businesses face systemic barriers - including lack of access to capital, networks and tools - when it comes to establishing, growing and scaling their companies."
Community Relations,"Additionally, as JPMorgan Chase Institute research has shown, the typical White-owned business has an additional week of cash liquidity compared to Black-owned businesses - critical days of buffer during stress periods like the pandemic."
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase is working to level the playing field for diverse entrepreneurs through products, programs, investments and policy recommendations aimed at expanding access to resources."
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase supports the development and utilization of qualified diverse businesses from historically underrepresented groups including companies owned and operated by minorities, women, military veterans, disabled veterans, servicedisabled veterans, people with disabilities and members of the LGBT+ community."
Community Relations,We have been committed to diverse entrepreneurs for decades.
Community Relations,"In 2020, as part of the Firm's $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment, we deepened our dedication to supplier diversity by pledging to spend an additional $750 million in Tier 1 spend with Black, Hispanic and Latino suppliers over five years."
Community Relations,"Our supplier diversity mission is comprised of three pillars: (1) increasing diversity within the JPMorgan Chase supply chain, (2) creating a supply chain that mirrors our customers' demographics; and (3) driving economic growth in the communities in which we do business."
Community Relations,Supplier development is also a key component of our mission.
Community Relations,"We invest in building diverse suppliers' capacity and expertise, positioning them to successfully do business with our Firm and also with other corporations."
Community Relations,"In 2021, our Firm spent approximately $2.4 billion on Tier 1 and Tier 2 diverse suppliers, including $1.2 billion with minority-owned businesses and $902 million with women-owned businesses."
Community Relations,"In addition, we have a dedicated effort to mobilize our Gold Suppliers - a network of over 100 of our most strategic suppliers that have achieved our top supplier designation - to promote supplier diversity programs, with an emphasis on Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned businesses."
Community Relations,"As of the end of 2021, nearly 40% of our Gold Suppliers had agreed to increase aggregate spend with diverse companies globally by more than $6 billion collectively over the next three years."
Community Relations,"In 2021, our Firm also committed up to $200 million to be co-invested alongside Ariel Alternatives in Project Black to forge a new class of Black, Hispanic and Latino entrepreneurs, as well as to nurture and grow minority-owned businesses in the Fortune 500 supply chain."
Community Relations,Our Firm is proud to serve small business.
Community Relations,"During 2021, JPMorgan Chase provided $22 billion of credit to small businesses."
Community Relations,"As part of our Racial Equity Commitment in 2020, we pledged to provide an additional 15,000 or $2 billion in loans to small businesses in majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities over the next five years."
Community Relations,"In 2021, we began building the infrastructure and foundation to deliver our goal."
Community Relations,We expanded a national program to help support minority entrepreneurs in historically underserved neighborhoods.
Community Relations,"Launched in late 2020, the initiative matches business owners - regardless of whether they are Chase customers - with a Chase senior business consultant who provides one-on-one coaching."
Community Relations,"By the end of 2021, we have hired 25 diverse senior business consultants to support this effort."
Community Relations,"Collectively, they mentored more than 1,000 Black, Hispanic and Latino small businesses and hosted educational events, community workshops and business training seminars with over 28,000 participants across 14 U.S. cities."
Community Relations,"Over the past two years, our Firm also deployed substantial small business lending through pandemic-related government relief programs, including the PPP."
Community Relations,"While PPP loans are not part of the Firm's Racial Equity Commitment, JPMorgan Chase was the #1 PPP lender on a dollar basis — over the life of the program, we funded more than 400,000 loans for more than $40 billion."
Community Relations,"In early 2021, our Firm committed $350 million over five years to grow Black, Hispanic, Latino, women-owned and other underserved small businesses."
Community Relations,"More than 40% of the commitment is expected to be low-cost loans and equity investments, supporting underserved entrepreneurs by providing access to capital"
Community Relations,This includes contributing $42.5 million in capital in 2021 to expand the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund.
Community Relations,"In collaboration with Local Initiatives Support Corporation and a network of CDFIs, our goal is to help create a nationwide program providing low-cost loans and technical assistance to minority-owned small businesses through CDFI partners."
Community Relations,"In 2021, the expanded Entrepreneurs of Color Fund closed 382 loans totaling $46.1 million to Black, Hispanic, Latino and other underserved entrepreneurs."
Community Relations,"By the end of 2021, the program had expanded to include Atlanta, Detroit, the Bay Area, New York City, Chicago, Greater Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles."
Community Relations,We are advancing policy reforms that promote access to capital and other support for underserved entrepreneurs.
Community Relations,"Informed by the JPMorgan Chase Institute's datadriven insights and the expertise of the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter, we support increased resources for the SBA Microloan program and modifying restrictions on SBA program participation for justice-involved individuals."
Community Relations,Additional items on our policy agenda include maintaining support for the Department of Treasury's CDFI Fund and improving procurement programs and policies to provide greater opportunity for underserved small business owners.
Community Relations,MDIs and CDFIs provide vital financial services in communities that are often underserved.
Community Relations,"Through small business loans, commercial financing, mortgages and more, these institutions supply capital to fuel economic growth and, in the process, play an essential role in helping individuals in these communities build wealth."
Community Relations,"In order to do so, however, many MDIs and CDFIs need additional capital themselves."
Community Relations,"Through our Racial Equity Commitment, our Firm is working to strengthen minority-owned and diverse-led MDIs and CDFIs by providing additional access to capital, connections to institutional investors, policy advocacy, support for diverseled commercial projects and mentorship and training opportunities."
Community Relations,"When we announced our Racial Equity Commitment in 2020, we pledged to invest up to $50 million over five years in the form of capital and deposits in Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned MDIs and diverse-led CDFIs."
Community Relations,"By the end of 2021, we had invested more than $100 million of equity in 15 diverse-owned and -led MDIs and CDFIs that serve more than 89 communities across 19 states and the District of Columbia."
Community Relations,"This additional capital will help these institutions hire staff, invest in technology enhancement and expand into new markets."
Community Relations,"According to the FDIC, every dollar of equity capital invested in MDIs can increase MDI lending by eight to ten times - meaning our Firm's $100+ million investment could generate access to as much as $1 billion in community lending across the nation, helping to create wealth, grow local businesses and improve customers' experiences in those communities."
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase provides holistic support for CDFIs, mobilizing different parts of the Firm to supply financing ranging from philanthropic and flexible capital to debt."
Community Relations,"The Firm also provides resources and technical assistance, which includes direct pro bono consulting support through its Service Corps program."
Community Relations,"In 2021, the Firm provided over $500 million in financing to CDFIs to support over 100 loan funds specializing in community development."
Community Relations,We look for ways to build on our partnerships with CDFIs.
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase invested in over $550 million of New Market Tax Credit project financing in 2021, the majority of which was in partnership with CDFIs."
Community Relations,"In 2021, J.P. Morgan Asset Management launched Empowering Change, which supports minorityand diverse-led financial institutions with the ability to develop new and reoccurring revenue opportunities by offering an exclusive money market share class to their institutional clients."
Community Relations,"At the same time, corporate investors gain access to these institutions to support their ESG-related investment goals."
Community Relations,"In addition, J.P. Morgan Asset Management has committed to an annual 12.5% donation of gross revenue received from the management fees on the Empower share class to support community development."
Community Relations,"In 2021, J.P. Morgan Asset Management's garnered over $5 billion within the Empower Share Class's assets under management."
Community Relations,"In its inaugural year, the Empowering Change initiative expanded its reach and impact across more communities by doubling the number of MDI banks it partners with, from four to eight."
Community Relations,"In 2021, a team of JPMorgan Chase employees spent four months putting their skills and expertise to work to help Liberty Bank strengthen its capacity to serve more customers."
Community Relations,"Founded in 1972 and based in New Orleans, Louisiana, Liberty Bank has grown to be one of the largest Black-owned banks in the U.S., with a presence in nine states."
Community Relations,"Through the JPMorgan Chase Service Corps - our skills-based volunteer program - the team helped develop a comprehensive customer acquisition strategy, along with enhancements to digital tools."
Community Relations,"This is just the latest in our Firm's relationship with Liberty, which began in 2019 through the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bank Mentor Protégé Program."
Community Relations,"As a protégé bank, Liberty was provided with support to address gaps that impeded its ability to further financial inclusion within underserved communities."
Community Relations,"In early 2021, we made a multi-million dollar investment in Liberty as part of our over $100 million investment to diverse financial institutions through the Racial Equity Commitment."
Community Relations,Investing in communities is a route to expanding economic opportunity.
Community Relations,"Housing, in particular, is a central pillar of community development because access to a stable, affordable home is a leading determinant of income and wealth, health and overall quality of life."
Community Relations,"Yet for many U.S. households, especially Black, Hispanic and Latino households, an affordable housing crisis has put this access increasingly out of reach."
Community Relations,"For example, 43% of Black and 40% of Hispanic households spent more than 30% of their incomes on housing as of 2019, compared with 25% of White households.30"
Community Relations,"Through lending, equity investments and philanthropic capital; community partnerships, and data and policy insights, JPMorgan Chase is helping to build stronger communities, with a concerted focus on housing."
Community Relations,"Financing the creation and preservation of affordable rental housing, and expanding access to homeownership, is also a core focus of our $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment (see page 21), because we know that the lack of affordable housing and rising costs of homeownership have been leading drivers of the racial wealth gap across the U.S."
Community Relations,"The Firm works to advance affordable housing solutions, bringing our industry expertise, a comprehensive set of financial tools and a strategy of combining our business and philanthropic efforts to create greater impact."
Community Relations,"As part our Racial Equity Commitment announced in October 2020, we pledged to expand on these efforts by financing the creation and preservation of 100,000 affordable rental units over five years through $14 billion in new loans, equity investments and other efforts."
Community Relations,"To help drive progress toward this goal, we created the Affordable Housing Preservation Program, which incentivizes landlords to keep rental units in their buildings at an affordable level."
Community Relations,"Thanks to these and other efforts, between October 2020 and December 2021, our Firm approved funding for approximately $13 billion in loans to help preserve more than 100,000 affordable housing and rental housing units across the U.S., and increased our Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments by $400 million."
Community Relations,Owning a home is critical to building wealth and ensuring financial stability over time.
Community Relations,"Yet, at the end of 2021, the homeownership gap between Black and White households was 31 percentage points - and was 26 percentage points between Hispanic and White households."
Community Relations,"To help address this gap, our Firm is expanding access to affordable homeownership through our home lending products and services, as well as through innovative homebuyer readiness programs and financial education services."
Community Relations,"As part of our Racial Equity Commitment (see page 21), we committed to originate an incremental 40,000 home purchase loans, or $8 billion in mortgages, for Black, Hispanic and Latino families over five years."
Community Relations,"We also committed to refinance an additional 20,000 mortgages, up to $4 billion in loans, to reduce mortgage payments for Black, Hispanic and Latino homeowners."
Community Relations,"To build the foundation to increase homeownership, we established a Community and Affordable Home Lending business."
Community Relations,"As part of this, we expanded our traditional home lending advisor network to include a new role called ""Community Home Lending Advisor,"" which is designed to be located in minority and low- to moderateincome communities."
Community Relations,These individuals are experts in local housing and down payment assistance programs.
Community Relations,"By the end of 2021, we had hired more than 150 Community Home Lending Advisors nationwide."
Community Relations,We also continue to enhance our home lending products to be more accessible to customers across the full economic spectrum.
Community Relations,"For example, to address two of the biggest barriers to homeownership, we expanded our Homebuyer Grant program to $5,000 to help more customers with closing costs and down payment assistance when buying a home in more than 6,700 majority minority communities nationwide."
Community Relations,"Home Lending continues to make progress in its lending commitments to Black, Hispanic and Latino communities:"
Community Relations,"During 2021, helped homeowners by refinancing 19,000 of the 20,000 incremental loans, nearly $5 billion."
Community Relations,"Originated nearly 12,000 home purchase loans for Black, Hispanic and Latino households in 2021, totaling more than $4 billion."
Community Relations,"While the number of units was slightly below 2019 production volume, the Firm continues to pace towards originating an incremental 40,000 by 2025."
Community Relations,"In 2021, we made a five-year, $400 million commitment that includes low-cost loans, equity and grants targeted to nonprofits and other organizations working to improve housing affordability and stability for Black, Hispanic and Latino household"
Community Relations,"This includes launching a new initiative with the Urban Institute to identify, test and scale affordable housing solutions to better serve Black, Hispanic and Latino households."
Community Relations,"We are also collaborating with the Center for Community Investment to drive local systems change and promote equitable housing in Chicago, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans and Seattle."
Community Relations,"As part of the $400 million commitment, we approved funding for $20.4 million to eleven nonprofits working to test and scale models to improve household stability and housing affordability."
Community Relations,"To help stabilize households, the organizations are providing eviction prevention support, rental assistance, access to legal services and resources for small landlords."
Community Relations,"To help increase the supply of affordable housing and homeownership, the organizations are advancing single-family housing production, launching specialized mortgage products, and increasing the capacity of community land trusts and other shared financial equity programs."
Community Relations,"In 2021, JPMorgan Chase issued its $1 billion inaugural social bond and allocated an amount equal to the net proceeds of that issuance to finance or refinance the creation, rehabilitation or preservation of 223 affordable housing projects across the United States."
Community Relations,"This inaugural social bond issuance builds on our Firm's leadership in the sustainable bond market as well as our engagement with diverse suppliers, with the co-managers for the bond offering consisting solely of Minority and WomenOwned Business Enterprise and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business firms."
Community Relations,"The affordable housing projects span 36 states and represent 22,911 affordable housing units."
Community Relations,More information on the use of proceeds and expected impact metrics can be found in our Social Bond Annual Report.
Community Relations,Regulatory and policy changes are needed to both address systemic discrimination in housing and encourage more effective models for boosting access to and supply of affordable homes.
Community Relations,"In 2021, the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter released datadriven policy recommendations to improve household stability weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic, including:"
Community Relations,"Reduce preventable evictions by establishing eviction diversion programs, enhancing eviction protections, such as right to counsel, that protect tenants from unlawful eviction and helping develop a balanced and predictable eviction process;"
Community Relations,Increase housing availability by removing barriers to affordable rental housing production and expanding funding to boost the supply of affordable homes for purchase;
Community Relations,Protect economically vulnerable families from losing their homes in heirs' property partition sales and tax lien sales with due process protections in state property laws; and
Community Relations,Standardize the collection and tracking of state- and local-level eviction data to better inform policy decisions.
Community Relations,Another key policy focus area is working to reform the residential appraisal process to advance fair housing and address housing discrimination.
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase is actively engaging with industry partners and regulators to find ways to address gaps in the residential appraisal process, including establishing new anti-bias training requirements for appraisers, allowing equal access to valuation data and techniques, and promoting national standards that will allow for responsible expanded use of Alternative Valuation Methods."
Community Relations,"In addition, in 2021 our Firm donated $3 million to the Appraiser Diversity Initiative, a collaboration between the Appraisal Institute, National Urban League, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aimed at attracting diverse entrants into the residential appraisal field."
Community Relations,Our Firm is also providing mentors for trainees in the Appraiser Diversity Pipeline Initiative.
Community Relations,"This initiative, led by the Appraisal Institute and Fannie Mae, is designed to attract new people in the field, help trainees overcome common barriers to entry and foster diversity."
Community Relations,"The United Nations SDGs provide goals for all countries - developed and developing - to alleviate poverty and inequality, improve health and education and spur economic growth and employment, all while tackling climate change and working to preserve natural ecosystems."
Community Relations,"Achieving these goals will require unprecedented levels of investment in community and economic development, particularly in emerging economies."
Community Relations,Our Firm launched the JPM DFI in 2020 to mobilize capital towards sustainable development in emerging markets.
Community Relations,"By assessing transactions with anticipated development impact, the JPM DFI seeks to expand the market for development finance and attract capital to transactions that offer both potential financial returns and advance the SDGs."
Community Relations,"In 2021, the JPM DFI assessed transactions to have anticipated development impact for a total combined amount of $117 billion."
Community Relations,"JPM DFI also acts as development finance structuring agent for a diverse set of corporate and sovereign transactions, which involves assisting clients to measure, manage and communicate the development impact of their transaction with investors and other stakeholders."
Community Relations,"Access to relevant, useful and affordable financial services is a critical foundation for achieving financial stability."
Community Relations,"However, nearly 7.1 million households in the U.S. are ""unbanked"" - meaning no one in the household has a checking or savings account - according to the FDIC."
Community Relations,The FDIC found that not having sufficient money to meet minimum balance requirements was the most common reason households cited for being unbanked.
Community Relations,"Additionally, access to financial services is not equally distributed: Black, Hispanic and Latino households represent 64% of the country's unbanked, despite the fact that they make up only 32% of the U.S. population."
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase is leveraging our reach and expertise to expand access to banking, develop products that meet the needs of low- and moderate-income consumers and provide financial health education and other resources and tools that help people become financially resilient and, ultimately, build wealth."
Community Relations,"We are also supporting a federal wealth and savings agenda to pilot portable benefits, incentivizing savings policies to help families build emergency savings, and seeding baby bonds to build wealth."
Community Relations,"As part of our Racial Equity Commitment (see page 21), we pledged to help one million consumers open low-cost checking or savings accounts over five years through expanded awareness of our Chase Secure BankingSM product."
Community Relations,"Chase Secure BankingSM accounts have no overdraft fees and provide users with the benefits of being a Chase customer, like access to thousands of fee-free ATMs, free money orders and cashier's checks, Chase's mobile app and support from bankers in person or by phone."
Community Relations,"Chase Secure BankingSM has been certified by Bank On for meeting the National Account Standards as a low-cost, low-fee account."
Community Relations,"In the 12 months following our announcement of our Racial Equity Commitment in October 2020, we helped customers open more than 200,000 low-cost checking accounts with no overdraft fees."
Community Relations,"All told, since its launch in 2019, Chase Secure BankingSM has been made available to 1.3 million accounts to help people access mainstream banking."
Community Relations,"We continue to invest in our digital channels - including online and mobile banking - which are an important way for us to reach our customers and provide them access to our products and services, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Community Relations,"At the same time, our bank branches are a key part of our strategy to expand access to banking services."
Community Relations,The Firm has opened bank branches in all of the lower 48 states.
Community Relations,"And, since January 2021, we have opened 47 out of 100 planned new branches in LMI communities, many within Black, Hispanic and Latino populations."
Community Relations,"As of December 2021, approximately 27% of Chase branches in new markets are in LMI communities."
Community Relations,"We have also committed to open 17 Community Center Branches, which offer additional resources for communities that have lacked access to traditional banking, and to hire more than 150 Community Managers (see page 48)."
Community Relations,"In addition, we are increasing marketing to reach more customers who are currently underserved, underbanked or unbanked."
Community Relations,Our Firm provides affordable and scalable products and services that help our customers strengthen their financial health.
Community Relations,"Our aim is to not only offer tools that help customers manage their daily lives, but also provide access to products and services that enable them to meet long-term goals and make wealth-building investments in areas like retirement savings, education, homeownership and growing a small business."
Community Relations,"One tool we offer is Autosave, which allows customers to identify their savings goals and set up automatic transfers to fund them."
Community Relations,Autosave helps build a saving habit by automating transfers from customers' checking to their savings accounts and allowing them to monitor their progress through a savings dashboard.
Community Relations,The number of customers enrolled in Autosave grew by 39% in 2021 to nearly 3.3 million.
Community Relations,"On average, customers saved 47% more per month using Autosave in 2021 compared with the prior year."
Community Relations,"Another tool we provide is Budget, which gives customers a simple way to create a monthly budget based on their income, recurring expenses and flexible spending."
Community Relations,Budget then tracks all of their Chase credit and debit card spending so that they can stay on track and identify additional ways to save.
Community Relations,"In addition, with Chase Credit JourneySM we help consumers - regardless of whether they are Chase customers - build, manage and repair their credit."
Community Relations,"This free resource enables consumers to check their credit score and view their full credit report online, and also offers automatic alerts and a score simulator that demonstrates how certain actions can impact credit scores."
Community Relations,"We provide information about these tools, as well as other information and tips to manage a budget, grow savings and build credit, on our online Financial Goals resource center."
Community Relations,"In 2021, we launched a program to deliver financial health resources to HBCU students across the U.S."
Community Relations,The program - called #BackToTheYard presented by Chase - is one part of our broader Firmwide strategy to help close the racial wealth gap by investing in the success of HBCU students and the institutional capacity of HBCUs.
Community Relations,"Delivered through our Advancing Black Pathways initiative and initially launched at seven partner HBCUs, the program is designed to empower HBCU students to take charge of their financial health through education on topics such as budgeting, credit use and managing student expenses."
Community Relations,We are also making available for all HBCUs a curated set of web-based resources on financial health and other topics.
Community Relations,"Our aim is to deliver financial health education to 10,000 HBCU students annually."
Community Relations,"In addition, our Firm has committed $1 million annually over five years to the Student Financial Hardship Fund."
Community Relations,The money will be distributed by the United Negro College Fund and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund to students at HBCUs that need aid to stay in school.
Community Relations,"We know that supporting students with emergency funds - to buy books, pay a security deposit or medical bill, address short-term food insecurity or meet other needs - helps them to continue their studies and graduate, which makes a profound impact on their long-term economic success."
Community Relations,"As part of a five-year, $125 million commitment to improving financial health in underserved communities, JPMorgan Chase is working closely with community organizations to address the unique financial needs of people who too often get left behind, including low-income women, immigrants, people of color and the aging."
Community Relations,"In 2021, for example, our Firm provided a $3 million low-cost loan to Capital Good Fund, a non-profit CDFI with a mission to create pathways out of poverty and advance a green economy through inclusive financial services."
Community Relations,Capital Good Fund offers consumer loans as well as personalized financial and health coaching to families across multiple states.
Community Relations,"Capital Good Fund issues loans for emergencies, immigration expenses, energy efficiency upgrades, residential solar installations and other personal expenses."
Community Relations,Our loan will support Capital Good Fund's origination of consumer loans to low-to-moderate income households.
Community Relations,"JPMorgan Chase is working to advance policy that expands access to banking, improves cash flow management, develops and strengthens access to credit and builds savings and wealth."
Community Relations,"For example, we are engaging with regulators about ways to minimize the disproportionate impacts of overdraft fees on low- and moderate-income communities, advocating for flexibility in innovation around credit and liquidity solutions that are designed to protect consumers, and supporting policies around structural changes to public assistance programs."
Community Relations,Our belief in structural solutions to wealth-building informs our support and advocacy of baby bonds and other wealth-building policies that address the racial wealth gap.
Community Relations,"Across all these areas, we are sharing our Firm's insights, data and experience about the unique challenges, and solutions that meet the needs of lowand moderate-income communities."
Community Relations,Helping individuals strengthen their financial health and build long-term wealth begins with trust and access - which includes being able to walk down the street to the bank to deposit a paycheck or knowing where to get trusted financial advice or how and when to apply for a loan.
Community Relations,"In underserved communities, this kind of access is too often missing."
Community Relations,That's where our Community Center branches come in.
Community Relations,"Since October 2020, we have opened an additional 10 Community Center branches in LMI communities - bringing our total number to 12 - many of which are located in urban areas with Black, Hispanic and Latino populations."
Community Relations,The majority were built with minority contractors as part of our effort to engage more diverse vendors (learn more on page 40).
Community Relations,"At these branches, we are offering not only all our traditional banking services, but also collaborating with local organizations to offer free resources including homebuyer workshops, career and mentoring sessions and financial health seminars."
Community Relations,"The branches also have space to host grassroots community events, small business pop-ups and more."
Community Relations,"Since October 2020, we hired more than 100 Community Managers in underserved communities who serve as local ambassadors to build and nurture relationships with community leaders, nonprofit partners and small businesses."
Community Relations,"Community Managers are dedicated to building trust with the community to offer guidance, expertise and provide accessible tools, resources and information related to financial health."
Community Relations,"By the end of 2021, Community Managers hosted more than 1,300 Financial Health events with more than 36,000 people in attendance, and participated in more than 600 Community Service events."
Community Relations,"2021 saw Stanley Black & Decker's philanthropic focus broadening from the humanitarian crisis response triggered by the onset of the global pandemic to once again include a more proactive, strategic philanthropic program."
Community Relations,We thoughtfully aligned our giving and community support to strategically advance our purpose and impact.
Community Relations,"Our approach included empowering makers, advancing racial and gender equity with a focus on the workforce of the future, and engaging our employees as advocates and ambassadors."
Community Relations,"In addition to providing financial support to deserving nonprofits and social programs, in 2021 we set aside tools with a retail value of over $2 million for donation to makerspaces, schools and disaster recovery efforts."
Community Relations,"Our people continue to work as catalysts for needed change with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs and Easterseals."
Community Relations,"To amplify the generosity of our people, Stanley Black & Decker matches dollar for dollar up to $20,000 per employee per year."
Community Relations,"Our strategic philanthropy team partners with our DE&I team to identify and activate nonprofit engagements to drive change, with focus on inclusion and racial equity."
Community Relations,Working with ERGs helps to ensure we are engaging with organizations that matter most to our employees.
Community Relations,"This has led to scholarships at Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) and focused initiatives with groups such as Out & Equal, Autism Speaks and A Better Chance."
Community Relations,"In the second year of the global pandemic, we maintained focus on relief, recovery and resilience, with additional efforts to support vaccination outreach."
Community Relations,We joined Gavi's international effort to improve vaccine availability and contributed to the Ad Council initiative to educate people on the importance and safety of vaccination.
Community Relations,We streamlined our disaster response strategy for more rapid and efficient response to disasters as they occur.

Chemical Safety,Compliance with policies and regulations on chemical substance management in countries around the world
Chemical Safety,The amount of chemicals discharged per unit84% (compared to FY2013 level)
Chemical Safety,Reduction of specified chemical substances contained in products: Completed the substitution of substances used in regulated products for the European market and continued control.
Chemical Safety,"Textile mills use some 20,000 chemicals and are estimated to generate about 20% of the world's industrial water pollution."
Chemical Safety,"To address this issue, we introduced wastewater effluent standards to the industry in the early 1990s."
Chemical Safety,"hen in 2000, LS&Co. was one of the first apparel companies to establish a Restricted Substances List (RSL), identifying chemicals that are restricted in the manufacturing of our products due to their potential effects on consumers, workers and the environment."
Chemical Safety,"In 2012, LS&Co. joined the Joint Roadmap Toward Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC), pledging to reach zero discharge of hazardous chemicals by 2020 — a set of goals we met and a major milestone for our chemical management program."
Chemical Safety,"Along this journey to sustainable chemical management, we have tried to play a central role in helping shift the apparel industry from a reactive system focused on products and RSL testing, to a more proactive approach that manages input chemistry through the Screened Chemistry program and the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL)."
Chemical Safety,Focusing on chemical inputs allows us to select the safest chemical options and better control options for the supply chain.
Chemical Safety,This eliminates hazardous chemicals from consideration before they even get to manufacturing facilities.
Chemical Safety,"With our suppliers, we have established an effective system to monitor chemicals going into our production processes."
Chemical Safety,And we have moved from a risk-based evaluation of chemicals to one based on hazards.
Chemical Safety,"The program provides guidance and a plan to eliminate priority chemical use and discharge, while supporting safe and responsible chemicals management."
Chemical Safety,"Through the RSSP, LS&Co. requires manufacturing suppliers to prioritize responsible chemicals management."
Chemical Safety,Our suppliers are required to work closely with chemical suppliers and analytical laboratories to ensure that responsible management extends throughout the supply chain.
Chemical Safety,This provides us with transparency into program implementation and promotes accountability.
Chemical Safety,LS&Co. checks on RSSP performance and compliance status monthly.
Chemical Safety,"Since 2015, we have focused on implementing the program with suppliers and aligning the RSSP with the ZDHC MRSL."
Chemical Safety,We believe in industry collaboration to bring scale and scope to our commitment to zero discharge of hazardous chemicals.
Chemical Safety,"Although the words are sometimes used synonymously, hazard refers to a substance's inherent properties that make it capable of causing harm to human health or the environment."
Chemical Safety,"Risk, on the other hand, is the possibility or likelihood of a harmful event coming from exposure to a substance."
Chemical Safety,That's why we see preventing hazards as the right approach to chemical management.
Chemical Safety,"As part of our continued evolution in sourcing the safest possible chemicals in our supply chain, the Screened Chemistry system was designed to shift us and our suppliers from a risk-based to a hazard-based chemical management approach."
Chemical Safety,"Since 2014, we have been evaluating chemical formulations from a hazard lens with the help of third-party toxicology experts."
Chemical Safety,This includes looking at the full material disclosure of chemical compounds in a given substance to make the right selection.
Chemical Safety,Screened Chemistry allows us to validate all incoming chemicals through hazard assessment and make sure they are free of harmful substances.
Chemical Safety,"This is in contrast to the risk-based approach, which does not require full disclosure and can only reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes and unsafe outputs at the end of the wastewater pipeline."
Chemical Safety,"Our RSL and the ZDHC MRSL indicate chemicals that are banned or limited to a certain threshold in our products and in our manufacturing processes, respectively."
Chemical Safety,"But for the effective elimination of restricted substances from supplier sources, materials and products, we also consider the hazards posed by full chemical formulation disclosures through the Screened Chemistry program."
Chemical Safety,"LS&Co.'s pioneering Screened Chemistry program examines chemicals used to manufacture our products against specific health and environmental impacts, allowing us to identify better alternatives and areas for innovation."
Chemical Safety,"Over the past five years, about 150 factories in the LS&Co. supply chain used our preferred chemicals list, which represents safer alternatives for manufacturing, and the aim is for all LS&Co. suppliers to use the preferred chemical list."
Chemical Safety,"This is a much more proactive approach to sustainable chemicals management in the industry, and one that we open sourced to benefit the entire supply chain."
Chemical Safety,"To date, we have screened and cleared approximately 1,300 of our highest-use chemicals."
Chemical Safety,"Screening was performed by a toxicologist, validating RSL and ZDHC MRSL compliance as well as ensuring full material disclosure of the chemical formulation."
Chemical Safety,"We have shared the Screened Chemistry program with others in the industry and with the ZDHC Foundation, which is working on adopting the program as part of the ZDHC Aspirational Chemical Management level."
Chemical Safety,"Importantly, the Screened Chemistry approach exceeds legal requirements for chemical safety."
Chemical Safety,It also includes commodity chemicals — the bulk chemicals that serve as building blocks in chemical processes and are the largest volume of chemicals used in apparel supply chains.
Chemical Safety,Including commodity chemicals in the Screened Chemistry approach is a breakthrough for our supply chain.
Chemical Safety,"The commodity chemicals used in the apparel industry sometimes come from other industries, such as pharmaceuticals, and can contain impurities, residuals or contaminants from those other industrial uses."
Chemical Safety,"Under the Screened Chemistry process, any impurity or addition to a chemical must be disclosed and meet the ZDHC MRSL."
Chemical Safety,This comprehensive and thorough approach is the first of its kind in the apparel industry.
Chemical Safety,The program screens impurities down to 100 parts per million.
Chemical Safety,"For example, in our F.L.X. program, this means that if a compound offers 99.99% purity, but the 0.01% includes a component we have screened out, we do not accept that chemical."
Chemical Safety,All F.L.X. chemicals must be 100% Screened Chemistry conformant.
Chemical Safety,"Through our game-changing operating model known as Project F.L.X., we are replacing manual techniques and digitizing the jeans-finishing process, allowing us to reduce the number of chemical formulations used in finishing from thousands to a few dozen."
Chemical Safety,This is a major step in upholding our ZDHC commitment.
Chemical Safety,"As of mid-2021, 108 factories in our supply chain are uploading their chemical purchases and deliveries."
Chemical Safety,"This allows us to see the chemicals used, by weight or volume, on a monthly basis in those factories."
Chemical Safety,"Botanical, or plant-based, dyes offer potential as alternatives to synthetic chemical dyes."
Chemical Safety,"While this might be acceptable for very small clothing lines, such as capsule collections, customers generally prefer to know the color jeans, jackets or tops they order will be in the color they chose."
Chemical Safety,"In 2020, we vetted botanical dyestuff and dyeing processes to evaluate some of their environmental benefits compared to conventional dye processes and feedstock."
Chemical Safety,We determined that botanical dyes and process can save as much as 50% in water use than conventional processes.
Chemical Safety,The Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) program is a government waste management program in India.
Chemical Safety,Participating factories must either recycle or dispose of sludge in a government-controlled landfill.
Chemical Safety,Most choose to recycle their sludge onsite with the approval of government authorities.
Chemical Safety,Nine factories in the LS&Co. supply chain have earned the ZLD designation.
Chemical Safety,"Over the past two years, we also announced key partnerships to strengthen the program and prevent chemical hazards from entering apparel supply chains:"
Chemical Safety,"We partnered with the Hohenstein Institute to use the Eco PassportTM by Oeko-Tex®* certification system to enable enhanced testing, verification and transparency to chemical suppliers."
Chemical Safety,"We collaborated with two companies working toward sustainable chemicals management, Scivera and NimkarTek Laboratory, to pioneer cutting-edge approaches to screen and track bulk commodity chemicals in apparel supply chains."
Chemical Safety,LS&Co. is committed to responsible chemical management and to driving sustainable progress within the apparel industry.
Chemical Safety,Safer chemical use is fundamental to ensuring the safety of our products.
Chemical Safety,"As of January 1, 2016, LS&Co. stopped producing products with any perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) —chemicals that can make materials waterproof and stain resistant."
Chemical Safety,We extended the ban to cover short-chain fluorinated compounds in 2018.
Chemical Safety,"Our ban on PFCs and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances is significant, considering there are currently no equally effective water- and stain-repelling alternatives."
Chemical Safety,"The LS&Co. RSL prohibits the use of priority chemicals, including alkyl phenol ethoxylates, phthalates, short- and medium-chained chlorinated paraffins, flame retardants and others."
Chemical Safety,We are also taking measures to fully enforce our ban on alkyl phenol ethoxylates — chemicals used in some detergents and surfactants.
Chemical Safety,Suppliers are not allowed to intentionally use these banned chemicals in LS&Co. products.
Chemical Safety,"In addition to ensuring suppliers adhere to the Screened Chemistry program and encouraging them to use chemicals from our preferred list, we also conduct testing on finished garments."
Chemical Safety,"Globally, LS&Co. is consistent in demonstrating the utmost product safety compliance with regulatory requirements."
Chemical Safety,We experienced no safety non-compliances or recalls from 2018 to 2020.
Chemical Safety,We remain as committed as ever to advancing more sustainable chemicals management.
Chemical Safety,"Above and beyond our 2020 commitments, we will continue to advance strategies, programs and collaborative efforts with key partners to develop and scale chemicals management across the apparel sector."
Chemical Safety,"This includes continuing to partner with ZDHC and fellow member organizations to create more sustainable change at scale, eliminate hazardous chemical use and improve wastewater treatment practices across the industry."
Chemical Safety,We will also continue our collaboration with the Hohenstein Institute to use the Eco PassportTM by Oeko-Tex® certification system to better implement our chemicals management processes and create a template for the apparel industry.

Opportunities in Green Building,"In recent years, the Group's primary direction has been to make buildings with green and ecological features; and one such major project that everyone knows about, is Forest City, which was formally introduced last year."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Generally, urban water treatment systems are a huge engineering feat, and require complicated pipelines for sewage collection, and a huge sewage treatment plant to treat and recycle water."
Opportunities in Green Building,Country Garden's Chairman Yeung Kwok Keung proposed a solution that disrupts tradition.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Keeping in mind the idea of breaking up the whole into parts, the project uses multiple miniature water treatment equipment and wetland systems for sewage treatment, to ensure nearby emission, nearby treatment and nearby use."
Opportunities in Green Building,"This allows for construction of a sewage treatment system that is in sync with project development and construction, ensuring perfect combination between sewage treatment plant and ecological landscape."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Regarding urban water supply and drainage system, Country Garden also proposed the idea that Forest City should be equipped with a three-dimensional and smart pipeline system, just like a transportation system."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The water supply and drainage system pipelines don't need to undergo backfilling, and it is also unnecessary to excavate the ground for maintenance."
Opportunities in Green Building,"A large number of smart sensors are also installed in the pipelines, to easily monitor them, bringing forth the concept of ecologically smart city."

Opportunities in Green Building,The building's environmental protection and going green design plan was personally confirmed by Chairman Yang Guoqiang.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Since he intended to build a truly green and environment-friendly building, the entire building is covered with greenery."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The main tower of the headquarters building has 22 stories; more than 10 balconies have been used to present a form of picturesque disorder, with big trees and wall-climbing plants everywhere."
Opportunities in Green Building,"When planning this design, the Group also considered many practical factors such as distribution of tree varieties and wind direction on different floors."
Opportunities in Green Building,"For example, short trees were planted in windward locations, thus gradually weakening wind strength during typhoons."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Also, as the building is covered with vertical vegetation [If data about other green building material used inside the building are available, please provide them], air temperature inside the building is obviously lower than outdoors, effectively reducing artificial air-conditioning requirement."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The building's entrance is called ""Dream Corridor"" and its design was inspired from tropical rain forests."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Real and artificial trees come together almost organically, and a small stream flows under the green leaves, with several kinds of river fish swimming in it."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Dotted deer, monkeys, birds, squirrels and other animal replicas are also placed all around the grass and trees."
Opportunities in Green Building,"By integrating a beautiful landscape and greenery, people yearn to spend more time in such green buildings."
Opportunities in Green Building,The headquarters building's design is very successful.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Apart from unanimous praise from employees working in the headquarters, it also won ""Award for the Best Office Building Model for Human Settlement"" granted by Ministry of Science and Technology, in 2014."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The Group plans to consider the headquarters building as a blueprint to make other such buildings in other regions, so that more employees can enjoy a green working environment."
Opportunities in Green Building,The national government is promoting the construction of zero energy houses (ZEH).
Opportunities in Green Building,"While the concept of ZEH is based on the assumption that the energy balance is ±0, energy self-sufficient houses are designed to reduce their electricity purchases as much as possible."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The energy self-sufficient house developed by our company is designed to minimize electricity consumption, instead of increasing the capacity of installed solar power systems."
Opportunities in Green Building,The energy consumption of the house is managed in such a way as to eliminate wasted energy and the electricity to be consumed is that generated by solar power systems and stored electricity.
Opportunities in Green Building,"In developing the energy self-sufficient house, we tried to achieve a realistic price to facilitate its spread nationwide."
Opportunities in Green Building,One of the features to reduce energy use is its water heater.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Water heaters commonly used in households use low-rate night time power to heat water, and hot water is stored to be used during daytime hours."
Opportunities in Green Building,Our model heats water using electricity generated by the solar power system during the day.
Opportunities in Green Building,"With this model, the electricity generated by the solar power system can be immediately used to heat water."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In addition, the use of the water heater during the time when the outdoor temperature is high helps improve the efficiency of the water heater itself."
Opportunities in Green Building,Surplus electricity from the solar power system is stored in batteries.
Opportunities in Green Building,"In addition to the improvement of these devices and better thermal shielding performance, passive design also plays an important role."
Opportunities in Green Building,Passive design takes into account the reduction of the burden of the thermal environment by taking advantage of airflow and shade.
Opportunities in Green Building,These various technologies applied to SECUREA Toyota Kakimoto enable us to reduce the capacity of the solar power system to 6.16 kW and achieve a house that can self-supply energy from spring through summer.
Opportunities in Green Building,This energy self-sufficient house is open to the public as a model house for a year after the completion.
Opportunities in Green Building,We are planning to organize various kinds of events and workshops in the house.
Opportunities in Green Building,"The high thermal insulation of the entire house maintains an environment comfortable in summer and winter, reducing air conditioning costs significantly."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Passive design uses natural sources, instead of depending on such energies as electricity and gas, to control the flow of heat and air to achieve comfortable living in summer and winter."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In summer when the sun is high in the sky, the eaves and awning block incoming sunlight."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Heat-shielding plates are applied to the pavement to reduce heat radiation, and green plants are used as a fence to achieve transpiration effects in order to reduce the heat flowing into the room."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The double height space, without a partition, allows the warm air from the living room to escape through the window located up near the ceiling."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In winter when the sun is low in the sky and the leaves of the plants on the fence are shed, the awning can be folded to allow sunlight to come into the room."
Opportunities in Green Building,The effective use of ambient natural sources thus helps reduce the air conditioning load.
Opportunities in Green Building,A solar power generation system is installed on the roof of a house to generate electricity using limitless clean solar light.
Opportunities in Green Building,The system not only helps reduce daily heating and lighting costs but also is useful in case of power outage.
Opportunities in Green Building,The energy self-sufficient houses in this project are installed with a 6.16 kW system.
Opportunities in Green Building,"In spring and fall, ascending warm air in the ambient environment is used to expel the heat from the room to the outside, helping reduce the use of air conditioning."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In summer, ventilation fans are operated automatically to force out the heat."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In winter, dampers are closed to prevent cold air from entering the room."
Opportunities in Green Building,A heat exchanger type 24-hour ventilation system that adjusts the temperature of the outside air close to that of the air inside the room before supplying it.
Opportunities in Green Building,This system maintains a comfortable air environment and also contributes to reduced energy use by air conditioning systems.
Opportunities in Green Building,"A long-life, lithium-ion battery with high charge and discharge efficiency."
Opportunities in Green Building,The energy self-sufficient house in this project is connected to two units of a hybrid system (6.2 kWh) combining this storage battery and a solar power generation system (12.4 kWh in total).
Opportunities in Green Building,"Energy-saving equipment designed to ensure comfortable living with less energy, such as a heat pump water heater (EcoCute) and LED lighting, is used."
Opportunities in Green Building,A system that supports air conditioning by taking advantage of cool air under the floor in summer.
Opportunities in Green Building,"In addition, the system centrally controls air conditioning units and lighting systems to prevent waste from forgetting to turn them off."
Opportunities in Green Building,A system called SMA-ECO Cloud is also available to collect data from each house to visualize the energy consumption of the entire town.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Sustainability has been a key priority for Adobe since the beginning — whether it's how we manage our operations, contribute to a more sustainable world through our products, or work with our customers, partners, and other organizations to advocate for important policy changes."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The most successful companies today are also good corporate citizens, and we believe that we have a responsibility to our employees, communities, investors, customers, and the environment to operate our business sustainably and enable others to do the same through our technology."
Opportunities in Green Building,An integral component of our sustainability strategy is related to the operation of our buildings.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Built alongside three other Adobe buildings that make up our company's global headquarters in San Jose, the North Tower is the largest at 18 stories and 700,000 square feet, with the potential to accommodate 4,000 employees."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Recognizing that an office building of this size could have a significant environmental impact, we knew from the beginning that we needed to do our part to help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in California and design the new building to embrace sustainability."
Opportunities in Green Building,"As we began work on the first all-electric office building in Silicon Valley, our design team looked at some best practices in the space but had few buildings from which to draw inspiration."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Working alongside an outside consultant with experience in sustainable design and construction, we ultimately found three areas in which going all-electric would impact the building's GHG emissions."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Second, we converted the hot water heaters from gas to electric."
Opportunities in Green Building,"And third, we designed the heating system to be powered by electricity."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Eventually, we hope to switch all the buildings that we own and manage around the world to all-electric as new technologies become available."
Opportunities in Green Building,We believe that building decarbonization is the way of the future and is an important way companies can play a role in reducing GHG emissions.
Opportunities in Green Building,That's why Adobe has committed to a 100 percent global renewable energy goal by 2035.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Being a California-headquartered company, we've drawn inspiration from the enormous gains the state has made in reducing GHG emissions in the electric power sector and achieving a 40 percent drop in the past decade."
Opportunities in Green Building,"California has also taken bold steps to curb transportation emissions, including a requirement that all new cars and trucks be emissions free by 2035 and 2045 respectively."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Now, the State has an opportunity to scale up its climate leadership by tackling emissions produced by our buildings."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Doing so will require a shift to all-electric buildings, which will allow California to boost its reliance on clean electricity coming from wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In the United States, they account for roughly 40 percent of the country's energy use and GHG emissions."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In May, the California Energy Commission took an important step toward all-electric buildings with the release of draft language for the 2022 building energy code."
Opportunities in Green Building,The proposal includes important updates to the code that will help move the building market toward all-electric new construction.
Opportunities in Green Building,"As a company that has always prioritized environmental sustainability, Adobe is grateful to see the California Energy Commission's leadership in recognizing the value of all-electric buildings and keeping up the state's momentum on climate action."
Opportunities in Green Building,"California has been moving at light speed the past two years, with more than 40 cities and counties adopting local building codes and ordinances for all-electric construction in their jurisdictions."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Among the cities moving in this direction is San Jose, which adopted an all-electric new buildings ordinance in 2019."
Opportunities in Green Building,The city also has a 100 percent clean energy goal for all of its electricity.
Opportunities in Green Building,"In fact, we worked with the city of San Jose to push the community to go to 100 percent clean energy using true renewables, as opposed to offsets or unbundled renewable energy certificates, which buy clean energy elsewhere to offset local, dirty energy sources."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Decarbonizing buildings is not only essential to tackling the climate crisis, but it is also a significant economic opportunity."
Opportunities in Green Building,"That's why, last December, we joined 55 major companies and institutions urging California to prioritize policies that optimize energy use and reduce emissions in the building sector."
Opportunities in Green Building,Arguments for broadening the state's all-electric efforts are persuasive.
Opportunities in Green Building,Energy and Environmental Economics (E3) has produced several studies for California showing that the most cost-effective path to achieving emission reductions is rapidly electrifying buildings.
Opportunities in Green Building,"With so many potential benefits for Californians, we support and encourage California's leadership on climate-change policy."
Opportunities in Green Building,"We uphold the ""Green, Energy Conser vation, and Environmental Protection"" principles."
Opportunities in Green Building,"To put our commitment to green operations into practice, we utilise advanced technologies in the design, construction, and daily operation of our office buildings and data centres."
Opportunities in Green Building,"We track and comply with all applicable laws and regulations in China, including The Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China and The Law on Energy Conservation of the People's Republic of China."
Opportunities in Green Building,"We continuously promote energy conservation in our office buildings by adhering to the best practises for building design, the management and operation of facilities and equipment."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Our ""Management + Technology + Procedure"" approach underpins our energy conservation measures, through which we have improved resource and energy use efficiency and diminished the impacts of our activities on the environment."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Environmental and sustainable considerations are incorporated into the design and construction of our office buildings, including the green infrastructure design, adoption of intelligent facility systems, and natural ventilation and lighting."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Since 2011, all our new buildings in China have been designed to attain the Green Building Two Star standard and other relevant internationally recognised green building standards."
Opportunities in Green Building,We assess the progress of our energy-saving and other environmental performance indicators in office buildings and provide incentives for meeting the environmental targets.
Opportunities in Green Building,We have also upgraded environmental management measures for office buildings with an environmental management system.
Opportunities in Green Building,All Tencent-owned office buildings are serviced by property management companies certified for ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System).
Opportunities in Green Building,The Tencent Facility Management (FM) platform was launched to manage the energy consumption of office buildings.
Opportunities in Green Building,"The FM platform compiles and analyses the energy consumption on a monthly basis, monitors and corrects anomalous data, and generates energy consumption management reports."
Opportunities in Green Building,"All of our new buildings are equipped with a realtime energy consumption monitoring system, which allows for statistical analysis of electricity and water use by area and purpose."
Opportunities in Green Building,Only water-saving sanitary wares that are defined by the Domestic Water Saving Devices (CJ164-2002) standard are utilised in our buildings.
Opportunities in Green Building,We continuously seek ways to improve our energy efficiency by regularly evaluating our office buildings' energy consumption and optimising our energy consumption through innovative technologies.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Drinking water systems have been installed to replace the purchase of bottled water, thereby improving water use efficiency and reducing the usage of plastic packaging materials."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In 2021, we renovated the lighting system, air-conditioning system, and car park facilities at the Tencent Binhai Towers: (i) we replaced LED lighting in our lobby, optimised lighting duration for our underground car parks; (ii) we installed thermostats and fan coil systems with automatic switches in our IT machine rooms and power distribution machine rooms to reduce the energy cost for cooling; (iii) and we encourage staff to take part in green travel by installing electric vehicle charging stations and providing priority parking spaces for new energy vehicles (NEV)."
Opportunities in Green Building,"For Tencent Binhai Towers and Beijing Headquarters, we monitor the levels of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide inside the buildings with an online system, which backed up by a manual measuring system."
Opportunities in Green Building,A smart ventilation system is installed to respond to the changing carbon monoxide in our underground car park and carbon dioxide levels in our office spaces.
Opportunities in Green Building,"For our office cafeterias, the cooking ventilation comprises a fire-resistant environmental exhaust hood that removes oil droplets, activated carbon filtration, and air ionisation to ensure the oil fumes emissions meet the discharge requirements."
Opportunities in Green Building,Unnecessary electricity consumption is reduced in our daily operations by installing automatic switches for the lighting and air conditioning systems based on the local climate condition and the schedule of employees.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Employees are encouraged to turn off the light, the air conditioner, and other office equipment and devices before leaving the workplace."
Opportunities in Green Building,"We also have stringent onsite office management in place with routine inspections, where the property management companies closely monitor the electricity consumption, such as turning off office equipment manually in unoccupied office spaces."
Opportunities in Green Building,We ensure compliant waste disposal and have implemented garbage classification in all office buildings.
Opportunities in Green Building,We advocate waste reduction at the source and recycling through a number of measures:
Opportunities in Green Building,"To promote employee awareness around waste classification, we replaced the previous garbage containers with classified containers in the common areas."
Opportunities in Green Building,"For electronic products that are no longer suitable for office use, such as laptops, we encourage employees to claim the devices for personal reuse."
Opportunities in Green Building,Other discarded electronic waste will be recycled and reused by qualified second-hand vendors.
Opportunities in Green Building,"We entrust qualified third parties to harmless handling of hazardous waste generated in office buildings in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, such as waste toner and waste ink cartridges."
Opportunities in Green Building,We discourage excessive packaging of gifts for employees
Opportunities in Green Building,"For example, the mooncake gift boxes in 2021 were made from degradable materials such as sugarcane bagasse."
Opportunities in Green Building,The takeout boxes provided in cafeterias are also phased out in favour of eco-friendly alternatives.
Opportunities in Green Building,"Whether undertaking new construction or renovating existing buildings, we prioritize efficiency and sustainability, to minimize the environmental impact of our facilities across the globe."
Opportunities in Green Building,Buildings are responsible for about 40% of global energy use and approximately one-third of GHG emissions.2
Opportunities in Green Building,"Since our own operations consist largely of buildings, we have developed and are piloting requirements for all new buildings to be zero carbon by 2030, in support of our net zero commitments."
Opportunities in Green Building,"These requirements address both operational and embodied carbon emissions, inclusive of energy use, energy supply, integration with utilities and material use."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Citi is currently renovating a facility in Gray, Tennessee, to align with our zerocarbon requirements."
Opportunities in Green Building,The plans for this facility include features to reduce energy use as much as possible and to meet any remaining energy needs with renewable sources.
Opportunities in Green Building,Aligning this building with our zero-carbon building requirements will also benefit the well-being of those using the building.
Opportunities in Green Building,"For instance, a tight building seal will improve air quality and thermal comfort for those inside and will also improve energy efficiency."
Opportunities in Green Building,"One of our 2025 goals is to have 40% of our facilities, by floor area, LEED, WELL or equivalent certified."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In 2021, we earned certifications for several sustainable building projects in pursuit of this goal:"
Opportunities in Green Building,Guatemala (LEED Gold): Reducing the environmental impact of the interior construction of our offices in Guatemala was instrumental in our ability to achieve LEED Gold for this site.
Opportunities in Green Building,Design features include high-efficiency fixtures and equipment to reduce water consumption by 41.5% and electrical consumption by 15.7%.
Opportunities in Green Building,"In 2021, Citi Tower Hong Kong installed our largest on-site renewable energy system to date."
Opportunities in Green Building,This hybrid system generates energy for water heating and electricity.
Opportunities in Green Building,"The system includes 360 solar panels, which we estimate will generate over 85,000 kilowatt-hours annually, avoiding 70 metric tons of CO2 emissions each year."
Opportunities in Green Building,The site also has a small wind turbine.
Opportunities in Green Building,"With the installation of solar panels for two more locations completed in 2021, we now have six bank branches in Mexico with on-site solar generation."
Opportunities in Green Building,"These branches receive from 60% to 80% of their electricity needs from on-site solar power, including the branch pictured at right in Mexico City."
Opportunities in Green Building,The six branches have a total of 348 solar panels and a combined capacity of 115 kilowatts when operating at their peak output.
Opportunities in Green Building,"In 2021, these sites produced 64,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity."
Opportunities in Green Building,"In 2021, as a result of our health and safety practices, we received the International WELL Building Health-Safety Rating for all Citi facilities globally, including offices, operations centers, data centers and retail locations."
Opportunities in Green Building,This seal helps assure our employees and customers that our buildings are safe and healthy environments.
Opportunities in Green Building,"The seal is awarded to businesses that meet rigorous scientific standards, maintenance protocols and emergency plans to address concerns related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases now and into the future."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Building on the success of the WELL Health-Safety Rating, Citi joined the WELL Portfolio Program — a benchmarking program for measuring and improving organizational health performance across facilities."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The WELL Portfolio Program leverages the strategies of the WELL building standard, the leading health-focused building standard."
Opportunities in Green Building,"As a participating organization, Citi will receive an annual portfolio score based on our work to support and enhance the health and well-being of employees and customers who work in and visit our buildings every day."
Opportunities in Green Building,"We also reused 77% of the facility's furniture to reduce waste, and we were able to effectively manage construction-related waste, capping the volume sent to landfill at 31.7 kg/m2, which is 15% below the industry standard."
Opportunities in Green Building,Paraguay (EDGE Advanced): We earned our first EDGE Advanced Certification for our Agrovet Offices in Paraguay.
Opportunities in Green Building,"The Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) certification system evaluates buildings in three resource categories: energy, water and materials."

Opportunities in Green Building,"China, Taiwan, United States (LEED Volume Program): We accomplished LEED v2009 certification for 11 bank branches through the LEED Volume Program and achieved LEED v4 Gold for our fourth retail prototype."
Opportunities in Green Building,All new and renovated bank branches will be LEED Certified based on this model.
Opportunities in Green Building,"We are also planning a significant renovation of Citi Tower in London, headquarters for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region."
Opportunities in Green Building,"For this project, which we expect to complete in 2025, we are prioritizing sustainable building principles and employee well-being in alignment with LEED, BREEAM and WELL standards."
Opportunities in Green Building,"By renovating the existing building, rather than demolishing it to build a new structure, we will avoid releasing an estimated 100,000 metric tons of embodied carbon, equivalent to 21,748 passenger vehicles driven for one year.3"
Opportunities in Green Building,"We are designing Citi Tower London for energy efficiency from top to bottom, within the constraints of an existing building, and are factoring carbon emissions into our decision-making process."
Opportunities in Green Building,"The building will feature rooftop solar panels generating more than 52,000 kilowatt-hours per year annually — enough to power 18 average UK homes4 for one year."
Opportunities in Green Building,"Efficient fixtures will reduce water consumption by 20%5 and a grey water reuse system will help us save an estimated 29.5 cubic meters of ater each day, enough to fill 4.3 Olympic pools over the course of a year."
Opportunities in Green Building,"During construction, we plan to refurbish and reuse materials on-site to reduce waste and embodied carbon, and we will work to significantly minimize waste sent to landfill."
Opportunities in Green Building,"As we grow as a company, we strive to optimize our real estate portfolio. "
Opportunities in Green Building,"Optimizing the use of every square meter in our portfolio contributes to reducing our environmental footprint - each square meter saved is a square meter we don't need to heat, cool, ventilate or light up."
Opportunities in Green Building,"When building new offices and manufacturing sites, we take the opportunity to make our buildings as environmentally sound as possible."
Opportunities in Green Building,"With an eye on future growth, for example, our new campus in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, is designed with a strong sustainability focus."
Opportunities in Green Building,Its design and use of materials will be assessed on sustainability performance using BREEAM guidelines with score of 'excellent'.
Opportunities in Green Building,"For 2025, we strive to implement the most suitable green building certifications in new constructions - such as BREEAM, LEED and G-SEED - in the countries where we operate."

Opportunities in Clean Tech,All its commercial monitors meet the iNEMI definition of low halogen except for their PCBA and external cables.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Furthermore, parts >25g grams including PCBA and external cables in some monitors fully meet the low halogen definition of iNEMI."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The Company has completely phased out the use of BFR/PVC in all mechanical plastic parts (such as external covers, housings, etc.) across all its product lines."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,It currently prohibits the intentional addition of the following pollutants to any of its parts:
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The Company plans to use additional BFR-and PVC-free parts and materials across the Think and Idea family of products as acceptable alternative materials become available, working toward the goal to phase out the use of these materials across all newly introduced products."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Company continues to work with its suppliers to pilot new BFR-and PVCfree applications.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The Company recognizes that the phase-out of these materials is dependent upon the availability of suitable alternatives that meet its technological, cost, quality, environmental, health, and safety requirements."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Company has identified a list of materials and substances of environmental interest.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,These substances may be candidates for further restrictions in the future.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,It holds suppliers accountable for reporting the use of these materials through Supplier Material Declarations.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"An industry-standard IPC 1752A XML Full Material Disclosure (FMD) form, submitted via the Green Data Exchange (GDX), is the preferred format for confirmation of compliance to the restrictions and for reporting when substances in question are above the specified concentration levels."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Company's business unit environmental engineers utilize the GDX environmental compliance database application to perform a Bill of Materials (BOM) validation to ensure every part number used in building the product has the required supplier information.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Once the full BOM compliance verification is complete a detailed compliance summary report is generated to show the Company and legal requirements at the full product level.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As of the end of FY 2020/21, the Company's Full Material Disclosures (FMD) system has accumulated more than 70,000 parts with full material information, forming a big data set for materials and substances."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This big data set is a tool that can aid structural design and optimization, analyzing materials and mechanical properties, and improving product reliability"
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The Company does not exempt any of its suppliers from providing Full Material Disclosures, though it does allow considerations for confidential information."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Only 2.4 percent of component suppliers do not provide full material disclosure, usually for security or intellectual property reasons."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Company will continue its efforts to support full material disclosure.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Those who do not provide Full Material Disclosures are requested to ensure their components' compliance with its format of material disclosure, IEC 62474 declaration, test report, or selfdeclaration"
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Each product has detailed data of 200-300 pieces of similar parts, which is an important basis for the Company's design and R&D work, especially for the analysis of material environmental health and safety"
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Company informs its customers about the environmental attributes of its products and compliance with applicable laws and regulations through an industry-standard IT Eco Declaration form.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Consistent with its precautionary approach, the Company continuously analyzes the regulatory environment and considers input from its customers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders in the evaluation of potential health and environmental impacts of its products."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The Company weighs these inputs to determine the restricted substances, as well as the substances of interest to be tracked for reporting and consideration of future restrictions."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Incorporating post-industrial recycled content (PIC) plastics, post-consumer recycled content (PCC) plastics, and closed-loop post-consumer recycled plastics (CL PCR) continues to be instrumental to the Company's product development strategy and transition to a circular economy."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Using these engineered plastics not only saves the natural resources and energy that would have gone into manufacturing new plastics but also diverts these materials from landfills.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Company's increased use of CL PCR is helping to sustain the demand for plastic materials from IT products.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,These environmental benefits are achieved while still creating a product that meets the Company's highperformance standards.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The Company currently uses post-consumer recycled content in laptops, desktops, workstations, monitors, and accessories and is introducing its closedloop process in more products each year."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2020, the Company expanded the use of CL PCR to 103 products, up from 66 products the previous year."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,This year it also used CL PCR in a server application for the first time in the Company's ThinkSystem SR950.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Using PCC in IT products presents significant challenges due to the unique structural, performance, and cosmetic requirements associated with these applications."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"To overcome the continuing challenges of using recycled content in the design and manufacture of smart connected devices, especially notebooks, tablets, and smartphones, the Company's team of engineers works closely with its suppliers to develop and qualify new grades of plastic resins previously unavailable to the IT industry."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,These materials receive environmental and performance qualifications before their approval and use in their product applications.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"For CL PCR, the Company's research and development teams work with material suppliers and a third-party certification authority to build its CL PCR supplier and material process, including the ""Approved Recycling Standard"", the ""Quality Assurance Operation Requirements"", and the ""Recovery Ratio"" to validate their sources of waste and control processes using a hierarchical waste product traceability scheme."

Opportunities in Clean Tech,Began using CL PCR in two products (display and All-in-One desktop)
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Since early 2005, the Company's cumulative total use of recycled plastics in products has reached over 115 million kilograms (gross) containing PIC, PCC, and/or CL PCR, with net PCC of over 51 million kilograms and net CL-PCR of more than 9 million kilograms."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2020, the Company's use of plastics containing recycled content was approximately 5.9 million kilograms (gross) with a net CL PCR of approximately 4 million kilograms."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,These numbers reflect the Company's decreasing use of plastics overall resulting from successful efforts to make products thinner and lighter.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"For the Company's CY 2021 recycled content usage targets, please see the Objectives and Targets section."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Company was recognized by Corporate Knights as one of the 100 most sustainable corporations in the world.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The 17th annual ranking of the world's 100 most sustainable corporations is the result of a rigorous assessment of more than 8,000 companies with more than US$1 billion revenue."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2021, Lenovo was ranked #78 overall, marking an increased rank from #97 in last year's assessment."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Our Prineville data center, for example, is the first Apple facility to receive TRUE certification at the Platinum level, meaning more than 90 percent of its waste is sent to recycling or composting."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Such efforts helped limit the amount of waste sent to landfill to about 12,000 metric tons for our global operations."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Helping our suppliers eliminate waste from manufacturing is also essential to realizing our zero waste goals.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2015, we launched our supplier Zero Waste Program, through which more than 165 participating facilities can access guidance and tools to improve waste management."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Suppliers diverted over 400,000 metric tons of waste from landfill in 2020, bringing the total to 1.65 million metric tons diverted since 2015."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"While Micron's low-power devices support sustainability and climate change initiatives in customer operations and products, our manufacturing process remains an energyand emissions-intensive one."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We are updating these aspirations with two new time-bound corporate targets:
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Reduce GHG emissions 75% per unit of production in 2030 (compared to a 2018 baseline).
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Achieve 100% renewable energy in the U.S. by the end of 2025.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We also maintain our multiyear goal to achieve at least 10% energy savings (measured in kilowatt-hours saved compared to 2016 baseline energy use) by 2022.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"To achieve these goals, we are focusing first on areas where our potential is greatest, including our energy use and process gas emissions."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The semiconductor industry is also working to reduce emissions of fluorinated GHGs (F-GHG), a potent source of emissions that result from manufacturing processes."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In terms of energy savings, we have saved a cumulative 7% compared to our 2016 baseline through projects implemented in 2020."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We are also taking the first steps toward our renewable energy goal.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2020, we began negotiations to develop and procure new renewable energy in the United States."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In addition, we are installing solar panels at facilities in Malaysia and Singapore and will explore further opportunities for on-site solar as local regulations allow."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Micron is a member of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), a membership association for large-scale energy buyers, developers, service providers and nongovernmental organizations."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In early 2021, we joined our REBA partners in releasing a policy statement calling on the U.S. government to enact national policy solutions that will accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon power system by decarbonizing the grid and increasing federal funding for clean energy technology research, development and demonstration."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Achieving our GHG and energy goals requires incorporating sustainability into our buildings from the ground up.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We consider sustainable building attributes — such as LEED criteria, the world's top rating system for green buildings — as part of new building design."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Many of our newest buildings have achieved LEED Gold status, and we design and build all new construction to meet or exceed that standard."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"To improve the energy and emissions associated with existing buildings, we are creating roadmaps to reductions over the coming years."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Because both new fab construction projects and upgrades take years to design and implement, our plans take a long-term view."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In the near term, we are implementing AI tools, smart control systems and predictive maintenance to improve production efficiency and automation."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We have integrated 470,000 facility sensors into IoT platforms and control centers."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"And we use a real-time performance monitoring platform with video analytics, high-speed cameras, graphic units and deep learning to conduct automated root-cause and correctiveaction analyses."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This platform, which enables us to quickly resolve equipment downtime and process deviations, has led to an 18% improvement in labor productivity, 50% reduction in product downgrade, 22% improvement in time to new product ramp and significant savings in energy consumption."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Recent years have seen integrated oil companies and utilities investing heavily in a range of clean technologies, including renewable power, EV charging, power storage, biofuels, and CCUS."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"What will be the impact of these investments on company strategy, technology development, and the move to a low-carbon, global energy system?"
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Since 2017, we have collaborated with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the financing arm of the World Bank, on the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT)."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This innovative public-private partnership provides access to advisory services to suppliers who wish to invest in reducing their energy, greenhouse gas and water footprints, but need technical support or upfront capital to do so."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We initially engaged six key suppliers' manufacturing sites in South Asia, focusing on a PaCT assessment and solar pre-feasibility study in factories and mills (Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers)."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As part of this program, LS&Co. is covering the costs for eligible suppliers to undergo a renewable electricity assessment."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Where onsite renewable investment is feasible, we will collaborate with the IFC on a financing model, leveraging the IFC Global Trade Supplier Finance (GTSF) program, in which we have been involved since 2014."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The GTSF program is making available approximately $120 million for participating suppliers developing products for LS&Co.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Even more recently, in 2021, we expanded our partnership with IFC to provide further support to suppliers that have already begun implementing low-carbon investment plans and have conducted PaCT energy assessments."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This includes offering them access to lower-cost financing to support their efforts, and together, deliver meaningful climate action."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"It provides access to capital for sustainability investments, which the supplier may otherwise not be able to finance."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As of early 2021, participating suppliers have reduced their GHG emissions and energy use by an average of 5.3% and 6.9%, respectively, per metric ton of product."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Suppliers have also reduced water use by 1.75% per metric ton of product.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,These initiatives have helped participating suppliers save $2.4 million in operating costs in total.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Where IFC has not launched the PaCT program, we encourage supplier participation in Clean by Design, a program now overseen by the Apparel Impact Institute and served by RESET Carbon."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,LS&Co. previously participated in this program when it was operated by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In China, 10 fabric mills that are part of our supply chain participated in Clean by Design between 2016 and 2020."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Clean by Design approach to supply chain efficiency works to improve supplier use of both energy and water.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Reducing carbon emissions is crucial to the future of our company and our planet.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"J.B. Hunt is elevating conversations regarding reduction of carbon emissions, use of alternative fuel sources, and sustainability in freight transportation."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We are active in CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the Alternative Clean Transport Fleet Forum.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Our long-term goal is to reduce additional carbon emissions by converting at least 25% of our day cab and straight truck fleet to an alternative power fuel source by 2035.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Achieving this goal is unavoidably dependent on factors such as the availability of alternative vehicles with a total cost of ownership at least equivalent to that of diesel-powered equipment and that offer similar performance specifications including range, weight, reliability, and uptime."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,J.B. Hunt actively evaluates and pursues alternative energy trucks.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"New technologies such as battery electric, hydrogen, or natural gas Class 8 vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Therefore, we are working to reduce the perceived obstacles to new technologies: capital costs, increased operation and maintenance costs, resale market limitations, OEM reputation and reliability, and insufficient refueling infrastructure."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We proactively participate in alternative fuel vehicle pilot programs to support the transition to a low-carbon future:
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Natural gas vehicles initially emerged as a viable alternative fuel and emission reduction opportunity in 2008.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Since that time, we have worked directly with OEMs, component suppliers, fuel suppliers, and infrastructure developers to address both short- and mid-term equipment strategies and test various natural gas trucks."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We have also prepared total cost of ownership and viability studies.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We continue to operate 180 natural gaspowered trucks with a select customer as an alternative to diesel-powered trucks.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Use of natural gas still results in carbon emissions; however, a reduction of approximately 15 to 30% in carbon emissions is realistically obtainable (depending on the amount of RNG in the operation's supply stream) in comparison to diesel fuel combustion."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,J.B. Hunt is one of the first transportation companies to place an order for Class 8 battery electric vehicle (BEV) trucks and we remain optimistic about their future.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We deployed five Class 4 eCanter BEV trucks in our Final Mile operations between January 2019 and September 2020.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Our initial experience with this pilot program showed that range, speed, available cube space, and required infrastructure created operational and financial challenges."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2020, we completed our first delivery using the Freightliner eCascadia, Daimler Trucks North America's (DTNA's) all-electric Class 8 truck."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We conducted a three-month pilot program that integrated the eCascadia into our day-to-day fleet operations in Los Angeles.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,DTNA plans to start production on the vehicles in 2022.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We are working with several OEMs, including DTNA, Navistar, PACCAR, and Volvo, to pilot their BEVs designated for regional, local distribution, and last-mile logistics applications."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Collaboration between vehicle manufacturer and transportation logistics experts is a necessity to develop these effective industry-leading technologies, and J.B. Hunt is proud to participate."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We are also looking ahead, considering the robust support system that must be developed to support BEV initiatives, including additional tractor depots and charging stations."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,J.B. Hunt is a launch customer of all-electric semi-trucks with multiple manufacturers including Tesla and Freightliner with multiple trucks on order.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"To promote the production of long-haul fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) by 2024, J.B."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Hunt is collaborating with Navistar International Corporation, General Motors Company, and OneH2 to pilot test FCEVs in late 2022."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,It is anticipated that FCEVs will provide lighter-weight and longer-range trucks that require fewer charging station visits in comparison to BEVs.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Based on thirdparty studies, and dependent on the source of the hydrogen, FCEVs have the potential to eliminate carbon emissions entirely, but the technology is emerging and untested for large vehicles and would require significant supporting infrastructure investment."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We aim to make not only our trucks but also our corporate offices more sustainable.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2020, J.B. Hunt worked with a third-party consultant, Edison Energy, to help design a solar project that will offset more than 80% of the electricity consumed at our main corporate headquarters."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We conducted a request for proposals and awarded the project to NextEra Energy.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"When implemented, the project will consist of two arrays."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The second system will be a 420- kWac solar carport that will provide cover for more than 140 employee vehicles.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Hunt is finalizing contracting and design, completing property due diligence, and working to obtain Public Service Commission permit approval."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The project is scheduled to break ground in 2022.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We work to reduce hazardous substances in our products and find environmentally-sound alternatives, without compromising performance and quality."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We follow all relevant regulations for substance restrictions, including the European Union (EU) directive on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances, China's Management Methods and the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We take a precautionary approach to materials selection and have compiled a list of 82 substances or substance groups targeted for exclusion, reduction or reporting."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Please see the list of specific substances here.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We have collected Full Material Content data from our direct material suppliers for many years which has allowed us to develop an extensive database of our product material content.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We leveraged this position in 2020 to develop compliance processes for the new registration requirements under the ""Substances of Concern In articles as such or in complex objects (Products)"" (also referred to as SCIP) established under the EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD)."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Convene a roundtable of companies involved across the electric vehicle ecosystem, and facilitate a product design sprint to develop potential products from ideation to reality"
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Lead research to understand the insurance implications of sustainable marine initiatives, including the risk profile of potential maritime fuels of the future such as Ammonia, Methanol and Hydrogen"
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Over 90% of our supply is locally sourced; each store accepts donations on behalf of a nonprofit partner in the local community, delivers a broad selection for our customers, and at the same time reduces transportation costs and emissions typically associated with the production and distribution of new merchandise."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We are also committed to further reducing our emissions and energy consumption wherever feasible.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We recently completed LED lighting retrofits for more than 90% of our Canadian and U.S. stores and warehouses.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In upcoming phases of our new ESG program, we will examine other areas of emissions."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As part of the launch of our ESG Program, we are excited to announce the purchase of enough Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), to match our electricity usage with green, renewable energy at three corporate offices, our largest Canadian Wholesale Distribution Centre in Etobicoke, Ontario, and our largest U.S."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Wholesale Distribution Centre in Fife, Washington."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In doing so, we are making a down payment on our commitment to further reduce our emissions and energy use."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Our business model is built around reusing goods, resulting in significant landfill diversion."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We have expanded our categories of reuse over the last two decades and strive to maximize the life of materials.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,3.4+ billion POUNDS of reusable goods diverted from landfills between 2016-2020.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Between 2002 and 2017, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) found that clothing production approximately doubled while utilization decreased by 36%."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In addition, textile production is both energy-intensive and water-intensive."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"EMF estimates that the production of textiles resulted in 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2015, which outpaced the year's carbon dioxide emissions from all international flights and marine shipping, with additional impacts on local environments."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As part of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts' ESG strategy, the Company remains committed to addressing waste impacts."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Globally, governments continue to implement additional waste-related legislation, creating an opportunity for Wyndham branded hotels to exceed compliance expectations."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Mandatory recycling requirements, single-use plastic minimization, polystyrene foam and plastic straw bans, electronic waste regulations, and composting and food waste management are all important initiatives, and Wyndham aims to support these wherever possible in Company and Wyndham brand hotel operations."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Wyndham will continue to improve waste tracking measures for global owned, managed, and franchised hotels annually."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Wyndham's owned, managed, and leased properties had estimated waste diversion rate of 20% in 2021."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Wyndham Grand® Foshan Gaoming (managed) used 7,500 discarded plastic water bottles to build an environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional Christmas tree."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The plastic water bottles were collected from the hotel and were previously discarded by guests.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Wyndham Grand® Algarve (franchised) donated more than 2,000 items of furniture and decorations, following an extensive renovation, to several local institutions to better support their initiatives to combat addiction, hunger and other issues communities are facing."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,This resulted in significant waste being diverted from landfills and providing an extended life of these items.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2022, Wyndham aims to improve waste data capture and increase waste diversion rates."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Waste diversion practices are currently embedded within Wyndham Green Certification, with 25% of the certification items directly impacting waste diversion efforts."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As part of these efforts, the Company is exploring viable alternatives to single-use plastics -- including, but not limited to, straws, utensils, containers, and packaging -- to offer at our managed properties, while still ensuring a positive guest experience."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Wyndham will continue to use this program to accelerate waste goals and increase waste diversion globally
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Our Hydrocarbons & Energy business oversees energy management at Dow.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Many of our initiatives around carbon and emissions are also managed by the Energy business.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The business is led by a Global Energy & Climate Change director and a team of regional directors and energy managers who define the best integrated asset and commercial strategies for major sites and company exposures.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Energy Technology Center supports our efforts to optimize energy use and emissions through the implementation of energy efficiency projects within our sites.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Dow operates combined heat and power plants to provide power and steam to a significant portion of our operations.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Our Hydrocarbons & Energy business manages the power and steam procurement for the remainder in a way that balances sustainability, affordability and reliability."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2020, we added three solar Power Purchase Agreements in Kentucky, Texas and Brazil."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This expanded our access to renewable power by 50% to 800 MW of capacity, surpassing Dow's 2025 Sustainability Goal of obtaining 750 MW of its power demand from renewable sources."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Our decision to add more than 300 MW of solar capacity not only reduces company emissions by more than 200,000 metric tons versus previous grid sourcing, but also supports grid diversity with industrial contracts that bring new renewable capacity online, enhancing residential access to renewable power as well."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The project adds 200 MW of capacity to the region.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In Brazil, the installed capacity of the new Jacarandá plant for Atlas Solar is 187 MW."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"While Dow's Aratu site uses the majority of this energy, a significant portion is unclaimed and available to consumers in the region."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This sets the foundation for further expansion, economic and social development in the region through Atlas' investment."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Total energy consumption is aggregated as the sum of purchased fuels (primarily natural gas), off-gas from our manufacturing processes, purchased electricity, and purchased steam minus any steam and power generated by Dow but sold to third parties or to the grid."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Energy consumption outside of Dow is estimated using primary data for purchased quantities of raw materials and representative datasets for cumulative energy demand from the Ecoinvent v3 database.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The purchased raw materials coincide with those used in the estimation of Scope 3, Category 1 GHG emissions."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Other categories of energy consumption outside the organization are assumed to be significanty smaller based on prior estimates using Economic Input Output model data and were not estimated for 2020.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We are innovating nextgeneration manufacturing technologies, such as fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation (FCDh), ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and electric cracking technology (e-cracking)."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,These breakthrough manufacturing processes are at various stages of development and are part of our solutions to create a lowercarbon industry footprint.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We are taking a phased, site-bysite approach to reducing our carbon footprint by replacing end-of-life and high carbonintensity assets with more carbon-efficient technologies, and by investing in carbon abatement technologies, including circular hydrogen and carbon capture and storage."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Additionally, the technology requires less capital and has a streamlined process that supports greater reliability. In late 2022, Dow's Louisiana-3 cracker retrofit will be the first industrial olefins unit to use this advanced technology, demonstrating its versatility to right-size or tailor capacity to meet supply needs more sustainably."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Electric cracking: In 2021, Dow and Shell reported progress on our joint technology program to electrically heat steam cracker furnaces."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,This dual-path approach aims to support emissions reductions required to meet the companies' 2030 carbon reduction ambitions and their targets to achieve zero-emissions businesses by 2050 or sooner.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In the first year, the program has advanced electrification solutions for today's steam crackers while also pursuing game-changing technologies for novel designs of electrified crackers in the longer term."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The project was awarded $4.2 million in Mission-driven Research, Development and Innovation (MOOI) funding by the Netherlands government and will join forces with The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and the Institute for Sustainable Process Technology (ISPT). This multi-stakeholder collaboration aims to accelerate key milestones for near-term progress and longer-term breakthroughs."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"For our customers, this helps to improve the economic value of the installed base, increase productivity and reduce the lithography energy use per wafer."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"With a growing demand for enhanced chip functionality, the complexity and energy consumption of the overall microchip patterning process, including from our lithography systems, is also increasing."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"A major benefit of the wider adoption of our EUV lithography systems is the ability to simplify patterning schemes to create the most critical layers of a microchip, which reduces the need for applying difficult multiple patterning schemes - this translates into less overall fab energy and materials use to fully process a wafer when compared to a multi-patterning process."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"However, the laser light plasma technology of EUV requires high electrical power input, therefore our product energy efficiency strategy is focused on EUV. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Our challenge is to increase the energy efficiency of our products.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We have set ourselves the target to reduce the overall energy consumption of our future-generation EUV systems by 10% compared to the 2018 baseline model - NXE:3400B - by 2025, in spite of a increasing productivity. Our second target is at the same time to reduce the energy use per exposed wafer pass by 60%, as compared to the NXE:3400B (baseline 2018). To achieve this, we have developed and are executing an EUV energy efficiency roadmap."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The EUV light source is the key focus area of our current engineering efforts to reduce energy consumption because it requires the larger portion of an EUV system's total energy consumption. 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"The roadmap includes optimizing the sequence of the CO2 laser to produce the plasma for creating EUV light, for example by turning the CO2 fire off when the system is in idle mode and reducing the CO2 firing between exposures."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Our longer-term goal is eventually to cut the CO2 fire between exposures altogether.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This requires a feasibility study from our research team and our suppliers, to make sure that the laser beam path remains stable."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Another area for energy reduction is the cooling water strategy.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We identified ways, together with our suppliers, to use cooling water of a higher temperature to remove the heat in the EUV source and electronics cabinets."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This will reduce the amount of energy needed to cool the system, through recirculated process cooling water. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"To make this happen, we need to make sure that modules such as the drive laser can operate at a higher temperature, which we are currently developing together with our suppliers."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Other challenges include developing materials and coatings that can deal with higher EUV intensities, and improving the heat management of optical components - this includes the wafer itself, which heats up through the exposure to EUV light during the production process."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Tackling these challenges requires ongoing innovation and collaboration within our innovation ecosystem of customers, suppliers and knowledge institutions."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"By reducing the total energy consumption by 10% in absolute terms and at the same time doubling the productivity compared to the baseline model NXE:3400B, we aim to reduce the energy use per exposed wafer pass by 60%."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"To increase the productivity in number of wafers produced, we are continuously working on improving the conversion efficiency of wall-plug power to EUV light and on optimizing sequences, control schemes and other components, such as higher reflectivity mirrors and faster stages."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Most of our product efficiency enhancements are also offered as upgrades for the installed base of our lithography systems.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We made good strides on re-use and are committed to continuing to reduce waste streams. 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Building a re-use mindset and adopting it into normal ways of working is critical to achieving re-use and preventing scrap.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"For example, by replacing scrap bins in our factories with what we now call 're-use collection corners', we encourage employees to think of used parts as having potential rather than being seen as waste."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"To fully embed our re-use vision, however, there are several challenges to overcome and processes to be defined."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,To re-use As-New parts in a system requires traceability of those parts. 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This means we need to be able to trace its history, where it comes from, and know how many times it was used and repaired."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Across our operations, there are a variety of separate processes related to return and re-use. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We need to align those to an overall end-to-end re-use process flow.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Part of our new focus is creating awareness on design for re-use, and defining processes around how to include re-use in redesigns and engineering changes."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2021, under configuration control we reduced the risk of what we call 'broken life cycles' by improving the traceability of parts. We intend to finish this improvement by the end of Q2 2022, solving the broken life cycle issues we now have in 4% of our parts."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We also delivered some new re-use execution processes, such as 'harvesting at the supplier', enabling us to send purchase orders to harvest parts to suppliers, embedded in our sourcing and logistics process."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As next steps, we have defined five priorities."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"hese include planning of re-use before new, supplier re-use incentives and autonomy, high-quality reverse logistics, further embedding re-use in our Product Generation Process (PGP), and launching re-use change and communication campaigns across ASML and suppliers."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We are committed to re-using system parts, tools, packaging and other materials, whenever practical in our value chain to reduce and prevent waste and reduce costs."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We believe that re-use is a learning opportunity for all of us in the value chain, so we work closely on this with our customers and suppliers."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Our target is to increase our rate of re-use to 95% of defective parts in ASML factories and in the field by 2025.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Design for re-use through more robust and repairable designs at an early stage of development
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Return for re-use of transportation packaging and materials for shipments to our customers
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Repair at local repair centers to improve parts repair yields by reducing cycle-time of root-cause analysis and repairs
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Remanufacture modules and parts that return from the field to as-new quality
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Harvesting of end-of-life parts through disassembly to re-use subcomponents
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Our Reclaim program in San Diego (US) focuses on re- using a constant flow of returned parts. 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This program includes design for reclaim, improving the ability to re- use and recondition the assemblies to enable further increase of circularity of parts and materials, so that they can either be re-used for spare parts or incorporated"
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This program has been running successfully for more than a decade. In 2021, we achieved over 375,000 kg material savings."
Opportunities in Clean Tech," In 2021, we achieved over 375,000 kg material savings."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2021, we integrated re-use into our Product Generation Process (PGP), as a key element of preventing waste that will help us meet our long-term goals."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"ur design for re- use methodology contains five elements - reliability, accessibility, replaceability, repairability and re- manufacturability - to enable the re-use of parts throughout the entire product life cycle."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,This means that re-use requirements are now part of the product design strategy and specifications. 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"For example, through the modular design of our products and their components, we make sure that future upgrades, wear parts and components can be replaced as a single unit."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"hrough commonality in designing a part, it can be used in multiple contexts in the product and even in future product generations."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,The Re-use department's focus for 2021 was on embedding re-use into our New Product Implementation (NPI) programs and driving waste reduction in our 'reverse flows' (materials coming back to us or to our suppliers from the field). 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Work continues to resolve bottlenecks in the execution of re-use and to clarify direction, guidelines and 're-use rules' across the business."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We are also looking to further mature our waste reporting data.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"When modules and systems are shipped, either from our suppliers to our factories, or from our factories to our customers, many transportation materials are used, such as packaging, locking and parts, to ensure that the products arrive safely."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"These so-called auxiliary parts (plugs, caps, clamps, cover plates, flanges, auxiliary brackets, etc.) are removed on arrival. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Instead of throwing them away, these are re-used at use level (the highest level of re-use), so preventing them from ending up as waste."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Before sending these parts back for re-use, they go through an identification process and quality check, followed by logistic and financial processes required to sell them back to the original module suppliers or to ASML."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We are improving the re-use of packing, locking and transport materials from the field and factory, aiming to return and re-use 80% or more in the next installation or relocation. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech," In 2021, over 4,300 tonnes of transportation materials were re-used, up from nearly 4,000 tonnes in 2020."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We are extending local repair centers for service parts and materials, and setting up global repair centers for factory materials."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"There are currently local repair centers in South Korea, Taiwan and China, with plans for all our customer regions to eventually have one or more in place. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Global repair centers will also be set up at each of our factory hubs in Wilton and San Diego (US), Linkou (Taiwan) and Veldhoven (the Netherlands)."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"By enabling repair and re-use activities and taking ownership of repairs in the field, we are able to reduce logistics time, stocking of parts and our environmental impact."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"When a part is re-used, our customers expect it to be as good as, or better than, the original new part. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We set high- quality standards on 'As-New' parts and expect suppliers to be involved to meet these standards. 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"This qualification standard and requirement is identical to the one for new parts, meaning that the same specifications, performance requirements, warranty, and so on, apply."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We now have over 75 'As-New' release projects ongoing at over 25 suppliers. 
Opportunities in Clean Tech,Our ambition is to increase the use of As-New modules in our systems to prevent unnecessary scrapping of well-functioning parts and modules.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,We made good strides on re-use and are committed to continuing to reduce waste streams.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,To re-use As-New parts in a system requires traceability of those parts.
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"Across our operations, there are a variety of separate processes related to return and re-use."
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"In 2021, under configuration control we reduced the risk of what we call 'broken life cycles' by improving the traceability of parts. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"We intend to finish this improvement by the end of Q2 2022, solving the broken life cycle issues we now have in 4% of our parts. "
Opportunities in Clean Tech,"As next steps, we have defined five priorities. These include planning of re-use before new, supplier re-use incentives and autonomy, high-quality reverse logistics, further embedding re-use in our Product Generation Process (PGP), and launching re-use change and communication campaigns across ASML and suppliers."

Human Capital Development,"Furthermore, each and every employee works to improve their knowledge and skills and we provide the innovative value sought by society."
Human Capital Development,"People differ in terms of things such as values, how they live, personality, and individual capabilities."
Human Capital Development,There are also a wide variety of stances toward jobs and ways of working.
Human Capital Development,"For this reason, organizational management in the current era needs to provide frameworks that leverage the individuality of employees and allow employees to increase their capabilities in environments that match individual aptitudes."
Human Capital Development,The new ideal employee environment sought by HOYA is one in which all employees can fully exploit their capabilities and contribute to the organization and business through friendly competition.
Human Capital Development,"In response to the wide variety of capacity development needs of employees and in order to learn the specialized knowledge and skills required for the industry, the HOYA Group individually deploys the employee educational programs that are most suitable for each business division and region."
Human Capital Development,"For example, for Eye Care Company's human resource development and HOYA Electronics Singapore's participation in the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct seminar, please refer to our website."
Human Capital Development,The HOYA Prize is an award system that has been established for all employees with the aim of recognizing and rewarding the daily hard work and efforts of employees in order to communicate a spirit of gratitude toward employees that always do their utmost amid a difficult business environment.
Human Capital Development,"The award system does not stipulate any detailed standards, but winners are rather decided on by the CEO based on recommendations received from the managers of each business and human resource representatives."
Human Capital Development,"Development and Active Participation of Technical Personnel ""Engineers' Report Competition Program"""
Human Capital Development,"For the purpose of further boosting the technological capabilities of the HOYA Group as a whole, we convene an ""Engineers' Report Competition Program"" once a year as a place to announce achievements in technological development and improvement made in business divisions."
Human Capital Development,An award is presented for technical reports and unique technologies that are deemed to be particularly outstanding by executive officers who serve as judges.
Human Capital Development,"As the respective staff members in charge of technology in business divisions congregate at the event, it also serves as a place for them to interact with technical personnel of other divisions."
Human Capital Development,"Toshiba Group states ""We turn on the promise of a new day"" in The Essence of Toshiba."
Human Capital Development,"To achieve this, we are creating and promoting an open corporate culture, and have established fair evaluation systems while seeking to fully develop and deploy talents in order for our sincere, richly diverse and autonomous human resources with a passion for change to work together and to generate new value based on a vision of the future of the company."
Human Capital Development,"To create and promote an open corporate culture and a highly creative and productive organization in which each employee plays an active and autonomous role, to achieve The Essence of Toshiba, and to nurture a workforce that leads us toward growth and change."
Human Capital Development,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted our training program from classroom training to online training."
Human Capital Development,We also feature the promotion of diversity and inclusion in level-specific training to promote understanding and acceptance among employees.
Human Capital Development,"In order to ""turn on the promise of a new day"" by way of digital transformation, we took steps to inspire and develop employees."
Human Capital Development,"In order for Toshiba Group to ""turn on the promise of a new day,"" we will foster employees who help drive continuous change aimed at creating a new future and establish a framework that assesses and treats employees fairly based on their achievements and competency in relation to roles required within the organization."
Human Capital Development,"In addition, Toshiba Group will continue to support each and every employee in developing his/her skills and support independent career advancement through our diverse systems for talent development."
Human Capital Development,"We will also accelerate efforts to promote health and safety management, work style reform, and diversity and inclusion with a view to a post-COVID world."
Human Capital Development,"To ""turn on the promise of a new day,"" the Toshiba Group Human Resources Policy provides total support for people with a sincere passion for transformation who envision the company's future and cooperate with one another to create new value."
Human Capital Development,People who take on new challenges will be highly evaluated and rewarded for their actions and performance.
Human Capital Development,People who lead growth and innovation and take on new challenges will be assigned and trained.
Human Capital Development,A highly creative and productive organization will be created where each person can play an active role.
Human Capital Development,"In accordance with the Toshiba Group Human Resources Policy, we implement the following initiatives."
Human Capital Development,"Since FY2020, Toshiba Group introduced a new human resource system that clarifies the roles that employees should play in the organization, and appropriately evaluates and compensates for competency and achievements of employees who have a venturing spirit and who, as the first penguins, continue to innovate toward a new future, regardless of age and length of service."
Human Capital Development,We have changed our qualification system from one based on employees' ability to perform their duties to a role-based grading system that clarifies employees' roles in the organization and determines the grade based on those roles.
Human Capital Development,"Evaluations are determined by performance evaluation (reflected in wages and bonuses), which evaluates individual performance and contribution through goal management on an organizational basis, and competency evaluation, which evaluates the behavior expected of each role-based grade in the spirit of The Essence of Toshiba."
Human Capital Development,The competency evaluation of the head of the organization is determined by referring to the evaluation by junior colleagues (Multifaceted Evaluation).
Human Capital Development,"Then, the overall evaluation is determined by performance evaluation and competency evaluation and used for reviewing promotion or demotion in the role-based grade."
Human Capital Development,"Bonuses are performance-linked, and the amount paid is determined by (i) the portion calculated for each role-based grade, (ii) the portion reflecting company performance, and (iii) the additional portion for individuals based on the results of the performance evaluation."
Human Capital Development,"The portion reflecting company performance described in (ii) is reflected in the amount of bonuses paid, with the aim of fostering a sense of responsibility for company performance among employees."
Human Capital Development,"As for the performance evaluation described in (iii), the supervisor provides appropriate feedback to the employee, not only on performance evaluation but also on competency evaluation, having discussions for future growth."
Human Capital Development,Toshiba Group considers the development of successors and executive candidates to be important management tasks.
Human Capital Development,"Accordingly, we implement the Succession Plan to systematically select and develop successors for all management positions, from business managers to chief foremen."
Human Capital Development,"As part of the Succession Plan, candidates for key positions in the whole Group, such as business managers and corporate staff division managers, are designated as the Next 150."
Human Capital Development,"They are intensively trained and nurtured in the Next & Future Executive Talent Development Program, along with the Future 300, which consists of high potential employees under age 35 selected for early development."
Human Capital Development,"Among the national staff who are active overseas, we also select those expected to take the initiative in the whole Group, named the Universals, and assigns and trains them systematically."
Human Capital Development,"They are expected to play an active role overseas in the future launch of new businesses, overseas development and re-expansion of existing businesses, and post-merger integration (PMI) after mergers and acquisitions (M&As)."
Human Capital Development,"In addition, we have introduced a human resource system under which personnel with outstanding expert skills in the areas of focus for the Group are designated as Jokyu Experts (Distinguished Expert), who are then appointed as Chief Fellows, Senior-Fellows, or Fellows according to their level of expertise."
Human Capital Development,We aim to further improve our expertise through the optimal assignment and training of Jokyu Experts.
Human Capital Development,"At the same time, we will continue to produce Jokyu Experts, as a means to strengthen our competitive edge in business."
Human Capital Development,Toshiba Group has prepared guidelines for establishing organizations to optimize decision-making processes and to encourage open-minded communication between supervisors and junior colleagues.
Human Capital Development,"Organizations are established and managed based on these guidelines which specify the maximum number of organizational levels and the number of subordinate organizations, as well as the appropriate number of their constituent members."
Human Capital Development,Toshiba Group focuses on training to develop well-rounded global-minded talents who have deep cross-cultural understanding and the ability to perform their jobs through direct communication with stakeholders around the world as part of its efforts to ensure that diverse human resources can play an active role and grow.
Human Capital Development,We provide Liberal Arts Training*1 to develop well-rounded individuals who can embrace diversity and have the ability to think things through in each level of responsibility.
Human Capital Development,"In addition, we aim to develop global-minded personnel through international joint program such as the Overseas Management Course, which helps to promote understanding of Toshiba Group's philosophy and nurture bridge-builders*2 both inside and outside Japan."
Human Capital Development,"Toshiba has a long history of region-specific education, with programs held in Europe and Asia launched more than 20 years ago."
Human Capital Development,"To enhance our education programs, the Toshiba China Academy and Toshiba University in the United States provide training courses in China and the Americas, respectively."
Human Capital Development,"In order for Toshiba Group to leap forward as an infrastructure services company, it is essential to increase the number of AI experts."
Human Capital Development,"We are working to develop AI experts to increase the number of AI experts to 2,000 by FY2022."
Human Capital Development,"For example, we launched an AI engineer training program in collaboration with the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo in the first half of FY2019."
Human Capital Development,"We are training more than 300 highly-skilled AI experts by holding training sessions for approximately 50 people each, twice a year."
Human Capital Development,"We have also set up programs based on employees' knowledge and requirement levels, such as basic courses to provide AI knowledge, practical courses to perform hands-on training using AI tools, and courses specializing in deep learning, as part of our efforts to enhance in-house education."
Human Capital Development,Toshiba Group has various training systems to help form a common ground of understanding among employees and programs based on requirements at each career level.
Human Capital Development,"A program that is designed to help employees learn about the actions and values that form the shared basis for all members of the Toshiba Group, such as compliance* education and Liberal Arts Training."
Human Capital Development,"A program that seeks to develop global-minded people who can perform their duties not only in their countries or regions, but also at a global level, by accepting cross-cultural differences and directly communicating with Toshiba Group companies or stakeholders around the world."
Human Capital Development,"A program that seeks to improve basic knowledge, skills, and management capabilities required for employees assigned to a new position (leader, manager, etc.)."
Human Capital Development,"This program also includes training to continuously improve the management capabilities required of managers, as well as education aimed at acquiring knowledge and skills required for global business early."
Human Capital Development,"Aims to equip employees, based on their career stages, with knowledge and skills required for different job functions."
Human Capital Development,Training program for a select group of individuals who are candidates to take up managerial/leadership positions in Toshiba Group.
Human Capital Development,The training is held for senior management as well.
Human Capital Development,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we canceled or postponed training sessions to prevent infection in FY2020, resulting in significant decreases in the number of employees who participated in educational programs/training for the year, total cost of educational programs/training, and training time per employee (average)."
Human Capital Development,"Meanwhile, we have shifted from the formerly predominant face-to-face training to online training."
Human Capital Development,"As a result, most of the training sessions were held online in the second half of FY2020."
Human Capital Development,"From this report, we have decided to calculate the number of participants based on the figures for Toshiba Group in Japan, including those who have participated in e-learning and other education and training programs, and to calculate the training time per employee based on the number of employees in Toshiba Group in Japan."
Human Capital Development,"Accordingly, we have revised the figures for FY2019."
Human Capital Development,Toshiba supports the career development of each employee in an effort to maximize his/her current and future job performance.
Human Capital Development,"The Performance Management System was previously implemented on an individual basis, giving each employee an opportunity to review and discuss job objectives and job performance with their supervisors."
Human Capital Development,"To enhance the creativity and productivity of the entire organization, however, this is now implemented on an organizational basis."
Human Capital Development,"In addition, the Career Design System provides each employee with an annual opportunity to discuss and share their views with supervisors on long-term career development plans as well as on mid-term goals for skill acquisition, improvement, and the way to utilize such skills."
Human Capital Development,"In FY2020, we confirmed that 87% of all employees received regular reviews."
Human Capital Development,"We introduced the 360-Degree Survey in FY2015 to look at managers and senior management from various perspectives with regard to their day-to-day work performance and activities, with perspectives including those of themselves, as well as of their junior colleagues, peers, and supervisors."
Human Capital Development,"The survey is implemented every other year, and the most recent one was implemented in FY2019 with 264 employees, including senior management."
Human Capital Development,"In addition, in line with the introduction of the new human resource system in FY2020, we have changed the former 360-Degree Survey for managers to a Multifaceted Evaluation and established a system to conduct it annually starting in FY2021."
Human Capital Development,"The major aims of these initiatives are to encourage the growth of the participants by objectively identifying their strengths and weaknesses on a regular basis, and to enhance their leadership, which will lead to creating a more sound organization and organizational operation."
Human Capital Development,"Managers are expected to embrace the survey results and use the results to improve themselves and workplace communication, as steps to create a better corporate culture."
Human Capital Development,"From FY2020, as part of the overall review of the human resource system, we introduced various programs to support employees' autonomous and proactive career development."
Human Capital Development,"By creating an environment where each employee aims to enhance their potential and achieve continuous growth without having to passively endure constraints and changes in their environment, we will revitalize the organization and increase corporate value."
Human Capital Development,Programs to support employees' autonomous and proactive career development
Human Capital Development,Career development training for each age group
Human Capital Development,Training for each age group to support employees' autonomous career development
Human Capital Development,"A program that supports the career development of individual employees through interviews with internal career advisors, leading to organizational revitalization"
Human Capital Development,System that enables employees with strong motivation and interest to apply for jobs posted internally by each division and screened for transfer
Human Capital Development,Program that allows employees to take a second job that meets certain conditions on a request-basis
Human Capital Development,"Program that revitalizes the organization through personnel exchanges with companies and organizations outside the Group, leading to new value creation"
Human Capital Development,"Program that supports employees aged 50 or older who wish to pursue new careers outside the company, such as changing jobs, starting a business, or taking on challenges in new fields by using their skills"
Human Capital Development,"Toshiba Group has conducted the employee morale survey (TEAM Survey) every year since FY2003, as a way to gain feedback from employees."
Human Capital Development,"Through this survey, we periodically monitor the level of understanding among our employees towards the Company's various measures, and how firmly rooted they are."
Human Capital Development,We strive to improve the issues that emerge and leverage them to enhance the corporate culture.
Human Capital Development,"In FY2020, we conducted an anonymous survey targeting around 60,000 employees in 79 Toshiba Group companies in Japan and overseas, and received responses from approximately 92% of the employees."
Human Capital Development,The survey assesses employees' understanding of company measures and whether their working conditions allow them to demonstrate their abilities.
Human Capital Development,"Since FY2015, the survey also features questions regarding how the President and CEO and top management are perceived, the status of compliance and other measures."
Human Capital Development,"Although the score fell for ""Feedback from manager"" and ""Systems for growth and career development"" compared to the previous fiscal year, it improved for other items. In particular, the scores related to ""Integrity,"" ""Values,"" and ""Pride to company"" improved significantly, with the ""Engagement score,"" a key indicator, improving by 2 percentage points year on year to 22%*."
Human Capital Development,"Based on these survey results, in order for management and employees to come together and make improvements, our top management is taking the lead in declaring a commitment to build a workplace environment where everyone can voice their opinions frankly."
Human Capital Development,"By transmitting messages from top management and disclosing information more actively, we are making an endeavor to build an open corporate culture."
Human Capital Development,"In addition, we prepared and implemented an action plan for each workplace to create an environment that prioritizes change and improvement to the corporate culture."
Human Capital Development,"We also provide education on improving engagement and developing organizations for those in charge of the TEAM Survey, encouraging them to take action to foster a sense of ownership and improve the corporate culture."
Human Capital Development,"In this way, the leadership, mechanism and workplace each serve as drivers to enhance organizational capabilities."
Human Capital Development,We aim to have all employees take ownership of change and work to improve organizational culture.
Human Capital Development,"Toshiba has established the Toshiba Hotline for providing information and consulting on action that may be problematic relative to laws, regulations, social norms, corporate ethics, the Standards of Conduct for Toshiba Group, or internal regulations."
Human Capital Development,"The aim of the hotline is to prevent risks related to breaches of compliance such as legal violations and fraudulent transactions, and to promote the resolution of problems."
Human Capital Development,"Under this system, employees working in Toshiba Group in Japan, including non-regular employees, can anonymously consult full-time counselors on concerns they may have on such matters as workplace culture and interpersonal relations, personnel conditions, or harassment, by phone or e-mail."
Human Capital Development,"In FY2020, 129 cases concerning harassment and other issues in the workplace were reported to the Toshiba Hotline, and in each case we undertook measures that included conducting hearings with the person who made the report and related parties after obtaining the consent of the reporter."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart is committed to making retail a place of inclusive and equitable opportunity where people, regardless of where they start, can gain the skills and experiences they need to advance in their careers. Doing so allows us to attract, develop and retain the talent we need to deliver our distinctive omni-channel customer proposition."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart's mission to help people save money and live better is delivered by our associates who make a difference for our customers every day. As of the end of FY2021, we employed more than 2.3 million associates worldwide, with 1.6 million associates in the U.S."
Human Capital Development,"While a number of factors determine Walmart's business performance, we believe our investments to improve career paths for our associates, including robust training, education offerings, competitive wages, new ways of working and opportunities for advancement, have strengthened our workforce and contributed positively to comparable store sales and associate retention."
Human Capital Development,"As customer demands and technology change the nature of work, we are continuing to attract, develop and retain people of all backgrounds who can thrive in an ever-changing omni-channel environment."
Human Capital Development,"We believe investing in frontline retail workers also creates value beyond Walmart. Communities need good entry-level jobs at competitive wages to provide pathways for community members to acquire skills and advance to higher wage, mid-level careers, enabling workforce development and helping to sustain local economies."
Human Capital Development,Many entry-level people have the potential to advance but need the opportunity to gain specific skills for higher-wage jobs.
Human Capital Development,"Employer-based training and education offerings can help entry-level people earn a good paycheck while they acquire the in-demand skills—and, in some cases, formal education—needed to move up to roles with greater responsibility and higher pay."
Human Capital Development,"At the same time, employers are seeking qualified talent to fill their mid-level jobs and can look to retail and other frontline workers without college degrees as potential talent pools."
Human Capital Development,"Not only does upskilling benefit people, but employers often find it to be a cost-effective way to meet their own needs while growing and retaining valuable talent."
Human Capital Development,"The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated economic and technological transformations that were already underway, while exacerbating skill, education and economic inequities that have long existed."
Human Capital Development,"This has heightened the urgency to provide ways for people to learn new skills affordably, effectively and rapidly."
Human Capital Development,"With our position as one of the world's largest private employers and a major contributor to the global economy, we seek to accelerate the professional development and advancement of our associates and the general workforce through good jobs, competitive compensation and benefits, training and education programs, growth-oriented career paths and Walmart and the Walmart Foundation's philanthropic programs, as further described below."
Human Capital Development,Inclusion: We aim to build diverse and inclusive teams throughout our business.
Human Capital Development,"Our efforts include offering jobs with low barriers to entry, providing support and opportunities to develop and advance, identifying opportunities to further enhance diversity across all levels in the organization, as well as providing multiple avenues to engage with and provide feedback to management and company leadership."
Human Capital Development,"Well-being: We are focused on the financial, physical and emotional well-being of our associates."
Human Capital Development,"We provide competitive total compensation and benefits packages, including paid time off (which includes sick leave) and medical coverage to eligible associates, and we seek to improve job experiences through approaches such as scheduling that is predictable, yet flexible."
Human Capital Development,Growth: Walmart continues to design and invest in programs that help our associates develop the skills and knowledge they need to advance within our company.
Human Capital Development,"We provide on-the-job and specialized training, redesigned roles with a focus on cross-training and mobility, and for eligible U.S. associates, the chance to complete higher education debt-free through Live Better U (LBU)."
Human Capital Development,"Digital: To meet evolving customer expectations, we empower our associates through digital tools and prepare them for the digital present and future, including newer roles supporting our omni-channel business."
Human Capital Development,"Strengthening workforce development beyond Walmart: We use philanthropy and our ability to convene to strengthen the U.S. frontline workforce development system in retail and related sectors, with an emphasis on engaging employers and funders in innovative approaches to training and advancement."
Human Capital Development,"Entry-level jobs provide economic opportunity and paths to upward mobility, but sometimes people face barriers to employment. While employers use education degrees as a proxy for proficiency, such requirements do not necessarily correlate to skill, nor do they measure work ethic or accurately predict growth potential."
Human Capital Development,We use various strategies to increase access to make our overall workforce and talent pipeline more diverse:
Human Capital Development,"Since 2015, Walmart in the U.S. has:"
Human Capital Development,Expanded benefits while raising minimum starting wages by more than 50%
Human Capital Development,Built one of the largest private employer training programs in the country
Human Capital Development,Created an in-house skilling capability that allows the company to introduce new innovations and accompanying training at scale
Human Capital Development,Launched a college program designed for adult working learners to graduate debt-free through Live Better U
Human Capital Development,"Low barriers to employment: Walmart offers thousands of different kinds of jobs, creating a place for everyone."
Human Capital Development,For some it's a first job and for others a second chance.
Human Capital Development,"Countering degree inflation: There are many roles in the U.S. job market, especially in the service sector, where a college degree should not be required for career access and mobility."
Human Capital Development,"For example, we do not require Walmart store managers, who earned an average of approximately $210,000 in FY2021, to have a college degree."
Human Capital Development,"According to a Harvard Business School study, people of color are disproportionately impacted by degree inflation, and this inequity is likely to grow due to the impact of COVID-19."
Human Capital Development,"Valuing work experience: As an employer, Walmart values skills and knowledge gained through work experience."
Human Capital Development,We believe an emphasis on relevant skills and knowledge over educational pedigree makes it easier for job-seekers to find employment and to advance.
Human Capital Development,"COVID-19 hiring: In 2020, our role as an access employer expanded to include hiring those displaced from jobs due to the impacts of COVID-19."
Human Capital Development,"In 2020, we hired more than 500,000 new associates globally."
Human Capital Development,"We are looking at more ways to re-shape hiring practices to help non-violent, formerly incarcerated applicants and support them as they re-enter the workforce."
Human Capital Development,"Due to the long-term economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that access to jobs will continue to be an urgent societal issue in 2021 and we remain committed to helping people find meaningful work."

Human Capital Development,Our diverse associate base serves as a talent pipeline for future leaders in our company.
Human Capital Development,"Diverse talent and an inclusive culture equip us to keep pace with evolving business demands and to better serve our diverse customer base. We continue to improve our people practices with a focus on equitably hiring, developing and rewarding our associates; enhancing diversity across all levels; and holding our leaders accountable for progress."
Human Capital Development,"In FY2021, 46% of U.S. management promotions went to women and 39% went to people of color."
Human Capital Development,"To learn more about our diverse hiring and development practices and our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion, see Equity and inclusion at Walmart and beyond."
Human Capital Development,"Our latest pay equity analysis in the U.S. confirms that, taking into account relevant factors such as position, tenure and location, Walmart pays associates equitably regardless of race, ethnicity and gender."
Human Capital Development,We conduct analyses of pay and compensation practices in consultation with expert third-party firms following industry-leading standards.
Human Capital Development,We correct disparities through adjustments to pay or practices.
Human Capital Development,"To date, our analyses have focused primarily on the U.S.; we are in the process of expanding to cover our global scope and commit to annually updating this disclosure."
Human Capital Development,Fair pay is foundational to Walmart's high-performance culture.
Human Capital Development,"Pay equity analyses are part of a larger set of practices to support and develop diverse talent and to treat all associates fairly, consistent with our core value of respect for the individual."
Human Capital Development,Hiring practices: Gender-neutral job descriptions; interview training workshops and standardized interview questions; not requesting a salary history to set pay for external candidates; diverse candidate slates for U.S. officers and the Board of Directors
Human Capital Development,Pay controls: Market-based starting pay rates; limiting discretion on pay; reviewing pay and promotion decisions before finalization
Human Capital Development,Transparency: Providing the pay range for a position upon an associate's request; supporting associate inquiries regarding pay and providing confidential resources for raising concerns
Human Capital Development,"Our primary method of communication will always be human interaction—through meetings, collaboration, leadership discussions and listening sessions. Maintaining a culture of open communication means giving associates a chance to share what is on their minds, especially when they are unable to discuss with another leader or need confidentiality."
Human Capital Development,Our annual Associate Engagement Survey (AES) is an opportunity to hear from our global workforce.
Human Capital Development,"The survey measures associate sentiment on a variety of topics such as relationship with manager and team, career growth and opportunity, belonging, inclusion and company culture."
Human Capital Development,The AES also provides associates with the opportunity to share what is on their minds via an open-text response box.
Human Capital Development,"After the survey is completed, results dashboards are distributed to managers, highlighting their key opportunity areas and suggesting actions to create a more engaged workforce."
Human Capital Development,"For the FY2021 survey cycle, more than 60% of our U.S.-based associates participated, and nearly one-third of U.S.-based participants shared open-text feedback."
Human Capital Development,"While we do not have comparative metrics for results because Walmart's survey was designed specifically for Walmart, we monitor industry engagement survey benchmarks and believe our response rate and engagement are strong."
Human Capital Development,"Our Open Door process allows associates—from entry level to the C-suite—to share ideas, ask questions and raise concerns in good faith with their supervisors and other leaders at any time without fear of reprisal. Our Open Door philosophy is an integral part of our culture, reflecting a tradition of open communication and listening to our associates."
Human Capital Development,"When an associate wants to ask a question or report a concern confidentially, they can do so over the phone or via an online portal."
Human Capital Development,Here are a few examples of our associates' feedback leading to meaningful change last year:
Human Capital Development,"After the tragic murder of George Floyd, Walmart associates engaged in listening sessions to discuss ways to make Walmart more inclusive."
Human Capital Development,"Our associate-led shared value networks (SVNs) are facilitating these conversations, reshaping internal practices and influencing the education/workforce, financial, healthcare and criminal justice systems to advance racial equity as well."
Human Capital Development,Our associates working in our education SVN led a $5 million investment in North Carolina A&T to launch the Equity in Education initiative aimed at increasing the number of African American college graduates securing careers in fields critical to the nation's workforce.
Human Capital Development,"A store associate shared an idea with John Furner to close stores on Thanksgiving Day, which we implemented to allow associates to spend time with loved ones after working hard to serve customers throughout the pandemic."
Human Capital Development,"Associate feedback drove our efforts to replace our ""Statement of Ethics"" with a new Code of Conduct, which highlights how we bring our culture of integrity to life every day."
Human Capital Development,"Their input helped us revise the Code and provided actionable, practical information on each topic."
Human Capital Development,"During the process, we surveyed more than 6,000 associates, conducted listening sessions with hundreds of them and incorporated comments from stakeholders in each market."
Human Capital Development,Associates have access to a variety of resources to confidentially report concerns or grievances. Walmart strictly forbids retaliation against any associate who reports a concern in good faith.
Human Capital Development,"We train our associates to be able to recognize and speak up about retaliation and other issues. Walmart associates receive ethics training during onboarding and regularly thereafter. In FY2021, more than 940,000 associates received Ethics training."
Human Capital Development,"Reports can be made anonymously and are treated as confidential. To ask a question or report an ethics concern, associates can contact Walmart Global Ethics at WalmartEthics.com, via email at ethics@walmart.com or 1-800-WM-ETHIC in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada."
Human Capital Development,Our Code of Conduct outlines resources available globally. Learn more on the Walmart Ethics and Compliance page.
Human Capital Development,"Since Sam Walton founded the company, one of our enduring core values is Respect for the Individual. Consistent with applicable law and practice, Walmart respects the rights of associates to form, to join or not to join an employee association or trade union of their choice without interference."
Human Capital Development,Associates should exercise these rights in an informed manner and with the benefit of thoughtful consideration of available information.
Human Capital Development,"In the exercise of these rights, we believe in the free exchange of ideas, opinions and information, provided there is no interference."
Human Capital Development,"Manager and associate trainings include information on labor rights, including associates' and Walmart's responsibilities regarding freedom of association."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart aims to comply with all applicable laws and practices, and we provide resources for Walmart associates who have questions regarding these laws."
Human Capital Development,We encourage any associate with questions on labor rights to contact Walmart Ethics.
Human Capital Development,"As of the end of FY2021, certain populations of Walmart associates were represented by some form of third-party representation in 17 of the 26 countries in which Walmart operated."
Human Capital Development,"Competitive pay and benefits, along with predictable and flexible scheduling, make work more rewarding, while helping associates maintain stability in their jobs and encouraging them to stay with Walmart and grow their skills and knowledge."
Human Capital Development,"We aim to enhance financial well-being of our associates by providing competitive wages by role and by market as well as through standard-setting benefits, predictable and flexible scheduling practices, and by offering a high proportion of full-time roles."
Human Capital Development,Full-time roles can lead to greater take-home pay for associates while helping them gain the knowledge and experience needed for advancement.
Human Capital Development,"While the majority of our workforce is full-time, we'll always be a place where people can also find part-time roles. This helps many individuals who want to supplement household income and build new skills while managing other interests and obligations."
Human Capital Development,"Approximately 64% of our U.S. hourly associates are full-time, excluding Home Office associates."
Human Capital Development,These associates' jobs range from entry-level to supervisory and specialized roles in pharmacy or grocery.
Human Capital Development,"There are many different scheduling demands, both for operating the store and managing the personal needs of individual people."
Human Capital Development,"All associates, including parents, caregivers and students, have different pressures on their time. Walmart's scheduling system is built around predictability, consistency and flexibility while ensuring associates are there when customers need them."
Human Capital Development,Predictability: We provide Walmart associates with their schedules at least two weeks in advance.
Human Capital Development,"Many associates want even more predictability, so we provide a scheduling option where associates can work the same shifts for at least 13 weeks, enabling them to plan and prioritize important responsibilities outside of work."
Human Capital Development,"Consistency: In 2021, Team Scheduling rolls out in all U.S. stores."
Human Capital Development,Team Scheduling aligns the schedules of full-time members of an individual team so they consistently work together.
Human Capital Development,Shifts will begin and end at the same time and team members will have the same days on and off.
Human Capital Development,This model provides for a consistent up-to-40-hour/week work schedule.
Human Capital Development,"Flexibility: The Me@Walmart app allows associates to easily view schedules, swap shifts with colleagues and pick up available unfilled shifts, giving associates greater flexibility and ownership of their schedules."
Human Capital Development,"We also provide cross-training to associates so they are eligible to work in different jobs across the store, opening up opportunities to grow new skills and get access to available hours."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart provides regular Paid Time Off (PTO) and Protected PTO to part-time and full-time hourly U.S. associates in our stores, clubs and supply chain and empowers associates to choose how to use their paid leave."
Human Capital Development,"Paid Time Off (includes Sick Leave): Walmart's PTO policy combines paid sick leave, vacation time, personal time and holiday time into one category, giving associates flexibility in how to use their paid time off."
Human Capital Development,Associates earn regular PTO at different rates depending on their full- or part-time status or tenure and take regular PTO with supervisor approval.
Human Capital Development,"In addition, we also offer Protected PTO, which allows our hourly associates to earn up to 48 hours of paid time per year (more in some locations) that can be used anytime to cover scheduled shifts, without attendance consequences, when they are unexpectedly unable to make it to work."
Human Capital Development,Associates begin earning Protected PTO on their day of hire and begin earning regular PTO on their 90th day of employment.
Human Capital Development,"COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy: Beyond PTO, Walmart created a COVID-19 emergency leave policy in March 2020, which the New York Times editorial board said ""set a standard"" for the private sector."
Human Capital Development,The policy provides three different levels of leave to cover different associate needs. Level 1 allows associates to take an extended leave of absence without medical documentation if they determine they are unable to work or are uncomfortable at work due to COVID-19 concerns.
Human Capital Development,Level 2 relates to mandated quarantines.
Human Capital Development,"Leave is paid for up to two work weeks per continuous occurrence for quarantine mandated by a health care provider, government or Walmart."
Human Capital Development,An associate can have more than one occurrence.
Human Capital Development,Level 3 is available to associates who have a confirmed case of COVID-19.
Human Capital Development,"If an associate is unable to return to work after the two weeks of quarantine and tests positive for COVID-19, additional pay replacement may be provided for up to 26 weeks with medical documentation. Absences associated with an approved COVID-19 leave are not counted against associates."
Human Capital Development,The Emergency Leave Policy has been expanded to support associates if they have side effects after receiving either dose of a COVID-19 vaccine: associates may be eligible for paid leave (per dose) if they are unable to work due to an adverse reaction to the vaccine.
Human Capital Development,This COVID-19 emergency leave policy has been utilized by hundreds of thousands of associates. Read more about our response to COVID-19.
Human Capital Development,Expanded parental leave and adoption benefit: Walmart provides U.S. salaried and full-time hourly associates with the same maternity and parental leave benefits. Birth parents can access up to ten weeks of paid maternity and six weeks of paid parental leave.
Human Capital Development,"Birth moms can receive 16 weeks of paid time away when maternity and parental leave are combined. Parental leave applies to associates who become parents through birth, adoption or foster care placement."
Human Capital Development,Our parental leave policy provides six weeks of paid time off to bond with a new child.
Human Capital Development,"We also offer a $5,000 adoption benefit."
Human Capital Development,"In FY2021 alone, approximately 30,000 Walmart parents took advantage of these benefits."
Human Capital Development,"Associates can join us and begin working and learning on a team, receive role-specific Academy training and take advantage of a Live Better U education offering, if eligible."
Human Capital Development,Associates can use these experiences and acquired knowledge to continue moving up to roles with greater responsibility and higher pay.
Human Capital Development,Walmart has a proven track record of making advancement a reality.
Human Capital Development,"Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions."
Human Capital Development,"Our wage structure reflects varied market rates associated with each role, our geographic footprint (concentrated in the Heartland, but ranging from rural Nebraska to just outside San Francisco, CA with different costs of living and labor markets) and business format, such as our Neighborhood Markets (grocery), our eCommerce fulfillment centers and supply chain warehouses, our Sam's Club format and our Supercenters. In every market where we operate and for every role, we must have a competitive starting wage to recruit talent and run our business."
Human Capital Development,"For example, our distribution center and fulfillment center associates start at a minimum of $15 per hour. And 100% of our active Sam's Club hourly associates now make at least $15 per hour."
Human Capital Development,"In our store formats (e.g., Supercenter, Neighborhood Market grocery format), minimum starting wages for entry level positions vary by region and role, where entry level associates have the potential to make from $12 to $21 per hour, and team leads have the potential to make from $18 to $28 per hour."
Human Capital Development,We have raised our minimum starting wage by over 65% since 2015.
Human Capital Development,This approach creates new opportunities for upward advancement.
Human Capital Development,"For example, as of March 2021, we raised pay for 425,000 store associates in digital and stocking workgroups, with starting wages ranging from $13 - $19 per hour, based on store location and market. In September 2021, Walmart raised wages by at least $1 per hour for more than 565,000 U.S. store associates in our front end, food & consumables and general merchandise workgroups. This includes roles like cashier, checkout host and salesfloor positions."
Human Capital Development,"Average hourly wage: As of October 2021, after wage increases were implemented, the average hourly wage in the U.S. was approximately $16.40 per hour."
Human Capital Development,"High pay bands: Walmart has pay bands as high as $30/hour, depending on role and location."
Human Capital Development,"Bonuses: Walmart paid four special cash bonuses from the start of the pandemic through December 31, 2020 to U.S.-based associates."
Human Capital Development,"These special bonuses were in addition to our normal, quarterly bonuses, which are based on store, club and facility performance."
Human Capital Development,The 2020 quarterly and special cash bonuses totaled more than $2.8 billion.
Human Capital Development,"Quarterly bonuses: For associates awarded for each of the quarterly bonuses in FY2021, the total quarterly bonuses amounted to an average of approximately $1,400 per associate."
Human Capital Development,"Special bonuses: The special cash bonuses totaled $1,200 for each full-time hourly associate and $600 for each part-time hourly associate."
Human Capital Development,These bonuses provided compensation over and above the average total compensation shown in the wage table.
Human Capital Development,"10% discount: Walmart associates receive a discount card125 that provides a 10% discount on fresh fruits, vegetables and regularly priced general merchandise, plus select merchandise on Walmart.com."
Human Capital Development,"Sam's Club associates receive a Sam's Plus membership, plus a 10% discount on fruits and vegetables."
Human Capital Development,"401(k): We offer 401(k) contribution plans, which include providing full- and part-time hourly U.S. associates a match of up to 6% after one year for those credited with 1,000 hours of service during their first year. Associates are eligible to contribute to their 401(k) on their first day of work."
Human Capital Development,"Our 401(k) program had an average enrollment of nearly 700,000 in FY2021, and Walmart's company match in the U.S. totaled $1.2 billion."
Human Capital Development,"Stock ownership programs: Associates can participate in an associate stock purchase plan with company match. Walmart matches 15% of the first $1,800 U.S. associates contribute to their stock purchase program each year, up to $270 per plan year (age restrictions apply)."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, 41% of our active full-time and salaried U.S. associates participated in at least one of Walmart's stock ownership programs, including but not limited to equity awards and our Associate Stock Purchase Plan."
Human Capital Development,"Financial planning tools: We provide associates access to tools such as the Even app, which helps them manage their money and plan for bills, savings and spending."
Human Capital Development,"When unexpected expenses occur, our associates can also access earned wages ahead of scheduled paychecks."
Human Capital Development,"Financial education: Walmart provides educational tools and resources to associates about important financial topics such as budgeting, credit scores and investing."
Human Capital Development,We are committed to providing associates and their family members who utilize our medical plans with access to high-quality care.
Human Capital Development,"Walmart is at the forefront of employee health care innovation with a focus on quality, efficiency and effectiveness."
Human Capital Development,"We seek to set a standard for other employers as we democratize innovative offerings such as telehealth, behavioral health and Centers of Excellence."
Human Capital Development,COVID-19 leave and flexibility: see Financial well-being above to learn about Walmart's COVID Leave Policy.
Human Capital Development,"In addition, to give associates the flexibility they needed and meet increasing customer demand in our stores, Walmart hired more than 500,000 associates during the pandemic, and our four special cash bonuses were provided to eligible associates regardless of the number of hours worked, helping to relieve pressure on our frontline associates to work if they were not feeling well."
Human Capital Development,"Affordable medical coverage: For 2021, medical coverage starts at $30.50 per pay period for all full and part-time U.S. associates who have worked an average of 30 hours per week over the past 12 months."
Human Capital Development,This is approximately one-third less than the average premium employees pay at other companies nationally.
Human Capital Development,"Centers of Excellence: For associates enrolled in Walmart medical plans, our Centers of Excellence program provides access to some of the best specialists and hospitals for serious medical issues, often at zero cost based on plan enrollment and eligibility."
Human Capital Development,"To provide our associates with quality care, Walmart partners with leading health centers, including the Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins and the Mayo Clinic."
Human Capital Development,"The Harvard Business Review wrote, ""[Center of Excellence] programs are at the vanguard of U.S. companies' efforts to control health care costs while providing employees with superior care, and results have been dramatic."""
Human Capital Development,Grand Rounds: Our program offers expert medical second opinions to associates enrolled in Walmart medical plans and helps with finding a highly rated doctor to see in person.
Human Capital Development,This program is free for enrolled associates.
Human Capital Development,"Doctor On Demand: For associates enrolled in Walmart medical plans, Doctor On Demand allows affordable, nationwide, virtual access to health care providers for just $4 per use."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart has waived (since March 2020, and continues to waive as of June 2021) the co-pay during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Human Capital Development,"Walton Life Fitness Pass: For as little as $9 per paycheck, a Walton Life Fitness Pass membership provides U.S. associates and their family members access to thousands of fitness centers nationwide."
Human Capital Development,"A financial incentive for healthier life choices: Associates and their families can be rewarded for making better choices such as eating healthier, walking more or saving more with the Thrive ZP Challenge."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart is partnering with external experts utilizing science, data and technology to help associates enhance their emotional wellness through sustainable behavior changes."
Human Capital Development,"Additionally, Walmart provides support for self-care and mental health resources ranging from grief counseling to parenting to managing stress and anxiety."
Human Capital Development,Initiatives include:
Human Capital Development,"No cost behavioral health services: All associates and their family members, regardless of whether they're on a Walmart medical plan, can receive support for emotional wellness through Resources for Living."
Human Capital Development,This includes ten counseling sessions per type of concern at no cost and unlimited telephonic support.
Human Capital Development,Resources for Living also provides free resources such as a coping with COVID-19 webinar series and information on how to help kids deal with COVID-19.
Human Capital Development,Well-being services through Thrive Global: Walmart entered a partnership with Thrive Global to make resources available to all associates to strengthen physical well-being and mental resilience.
Human Capital Development,"Through our Centers of Excellence (CoE) program, we have partnered with world-class health centers across the U.S. such as Mayo Clinic, Geisinger Medical Center and Cleveland Clinic to provide treatments such as spine surgery, cancer evaluations, joint replacement and organ transplants."
Human Capital Development,"For associates enrolled in Walmart's health care plans, the Centers of Excellence program covers all costs, including travel, lodging and meals for the associate and a caregiver companion (except in the case of weight loss surgery)."
Human Capital Development,"With a few exceptions, there are no co-payments, co-insurance or deductibles."
Human Capital Development,"The results of the CoE program are clear: based on an analysis conducted in partnership with Geisinger Neuroscience Institute and Health Design Plus, Walmart associates who use the CoE program realize better outcomes than those who do not."
Human Capital Development,"For example, many CoE patients were able to pursue alternatives to spine surgery and joint replacements based on CoE assessment and care. Of those who did undergo surgery, re-admission rates were dramatically lower than they were with non-CoE treatments. Recovery times were also shorter."
Human Capital Development,"More than 95% of Walmart plan members say they are ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their treatment."
Human Capital Development,CoE-realized outcomes are far superior. See below:
Human Capital Development,"Source: Lisa Woods, Jonathan R. Slotkin, MD, and M. Ruth Coleman, Transforming Healthcare, Harvard Business Review (March 2019) (citing Walmart, Geisinger, and Health Design Plus)."
Human Capital Development,Preparing the U.S. workforce for the digital future is a critical aspect of workforce development.
Human Capital Development,"Many industries, including retail, are being reshaped through advances in technology to meet evolving customer expectations. Walmart is increasingly a digital company and we're integrating technology into our jobs to improve experiences for both customers and associates."
Human Capital Development,"Digital tools, like the voice assistant app Ask Sam, keep associate teams engaged while making work more rewarding, reducing repetitive tasks and increasing productivity."
Human Capital Development,"Most store associates are utilizing digital devices and custom apps to fulfill online orders, manage inventory, stock shelves and answer customer questions."
Human Capital Development,"Technology is also fueling job creation. In one year, our online grocery pick-up business grew significantly and we doubled the number of personal shoppers, the fastest growing role in Walmart U.S. stores—to over 160,000 associates in these technology-empowered roles."
Human Capital Development,"To attract and retain the best talent at all levels and in all functions, we aim to distinguish ourselves as a place of opportunity for associates."
Human Capital Development,Our workforce strategy is uniquely designed to promote upward mobility for our diverse workforce.
Human Capital Development,Over 88% of Walmart U.S. store roles above entry-level are filled by internal candidates.
Human Capital Development,"More than 300,000 U.S. associates were promoted to jobs of greater responsibility and higher pay in FY2021."
Human Capital Development,Many of these promotions are related to new roles created under our new teaming structure.
Human Capital Development,"We believe our focus on improving career paths for our associates through robust training, new ways of working and opportunities for advancement has improved turnover rates in the U.S. over the past few years."
Human Capital Development,"We've been working with and listening to outside experts and job design specialists about what makes a ""good job."""
Human Capital Development,"While there are many components of good jobs, including competitive pay and benefits, it also includes meaningful work and opportunity and support for growth."
Human Capital Development,"In FY2021, we introduced a team-based operating model to our U.S. stores—first piloted and implemented at Sam's Club—that focuses on cross-training and greater associate ownership over their work and store area while developing future leaders."
Human Capital Development,"Additional benefits will accrue because team members consistently work together and follow the same schedule, which develops a deeper team mindset while providing greater stability through a consistent schedule."
Human Capital Development,"Cross-trained associates will build additional skills, making it easier for those who want more hours to get more hours."
Human Capital Development,"Our team-based model is tiered with new positions, including new hourly management roles, that provide a ladder of opportunity and allow more room for pay and career growth."
Human Capital Development,"We raised wages between September 2020 and March 2021 for approximately 590,000 Walmart U.S. associates in our stores with the introduction of this new job design."
Human Capital Development,"Through teaming, associates are gaining more skills and a greater understanding of the Walmart business, leading to better customer service capabilities while creating more fulfilling work and wider career paths."
Human Capital Development,"Since 2015, Walmart and other employers have been focused on designing ""quality jobs."" Several organizations, including the National Fund for Workforce Solutions (NFWS), the Federal Reserve of Boston and Gallup, have developed frameworks and definitions of quality jobs that go beyond wages to include creating an environment that is stable and supportive and provides opportunities for growth."
Human Capital Development,"For example, the Job Design Framework from NFWS lays out three broad categories of components that define quality jobs: foundational components such as compensation and job structure; support components such as training, mentoring and team development; and opportunity components such as cross-training and career development."
Human Capital Development,"There is no single definition of quality jobs. Instead, various components are brought together in different ways at different companies for the right context. According to Anmol Chaddha, formerly of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the goal is for companies to engage in a virtuous cycle, taking small steps to improve job quality and realizing real business benefits from those improvements that lead to continued improved job quality and subsequent business benefits."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart provides opportunities for our associates to pursue a wide variety of careers across our omni-channel business while building relevant skills and experience that allow for vertical, horizontal and diagonal career movement."
Human Capital Development,"Training is a critical component of associate growth and success in a fast-changing retail environment. Through our new teaming structure, Walmart has embedded training and on-the-job development into the associate experience starting on day one with the company."
Human Capital Development,"We have turned our entry-level training program into a mobile digital experience, allowing for on-demand, on-the-job learning for our U.S. store associates. We are continuing to grow the functionality of this learning app to allow our associates to earn credentials for skills they have demonstrated, such as customer service or cake decorating, which we believe will help associates more easily navigate careers that use or build upon relevant transferable skills."
Human Capital Development,"Since 2016, Walmart's formal training program, Walmart Academy, has paid associates to learn. Through immersive teaching that combines technology, classroom training and ongoing coaching on the sales floor, associates learn retail fundamentals and prepare for their first supervisory roles and for advanced managerial positions. Walmart has built more than 200 Academies in the U.S. and we continue to build and open new facilities."
Human Capital Development,"In FY2021, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we trained approximately 95,000 associates via Walmart Academy, including in-person and virtual trainings. We have found that more than 80% of Walmart Academy graduates are retained for an additional year."
Human Capital Development,"Our higher education partners through Live Better U have also approved certain Academy trainings for college credit, and $9.9 million in college credit value was awarded to our associates in FY2021."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart won five awards, including:"
Human Capital Development,Walmart's Academy App provides salesfloor associates with just-in-time training on tactical tasks through the improvement of existing technology.
Human Capital Development,"Having knowledge available on their handheld devices in the moment, Walmart associates are empowered with confidence while serving customers a seamless shopping experience."
Human Capital Development,"The Walmart Community Academy is a combination of lecture and workshop to provide functional training to help participants develop personally and professionally. Offerings include career progression, personal finance and technology."
Human Capital Development,"In addition to our associates, we announced in June 2021 that we are opening up Academy training to non-Walmart associates in the communities we serve."
Human Capital Development,The Community Academies share knowledge and skills with local residents and focus on topics of interest to that particular community.
Human Capital Development,"Available courses may change over time and have included offerings such as resume building, interviewing, computer/mobile device basics, budgeting, banking, standardized test preparation, navigating college admissions and house and car buying."
Human Capital Development,Live Better U (LBU) provides eligible associates with free121 formal higher education opportunities that meet them wherever they are on their education journey.
Human Capital Development,"We designed our education program to remove the barriers that too often stop someone from getting a degree, specifically:"
Human Capital Development,"Cost: Walmart announced that effective August 2021, the company will pay 100% of college tuition and books for eligible associates through LBU, removing the $1 a day fee associates previously paid for some LBU programs. With student-loan debt in the U.S. topping $1.7 trillion, this gives associates a chance to graduate debt-free from an accredited university."
Human Capital Development,"Time: Students can save time by getting credit for previous learning, including paid training at Walmart Academy and credits earned at other institutions."
Human Capital Development,Navigating an unfamiliar system: Associates will receive support from an education coach on everything from selecting the appropriate degree to academic and retention coaching.
Human Capital Development,Relevance in a changing economy: The programs focus on in-demand degrees and certificates in relevant and growing fields.
Human Capital Development,Low completion rates among adult learners: LBU engages institutions known for their success working with adult learners and their focus on completion rather than enrollment.
Human Capital Development,"As we studied the best ways to build a college access program, it became clear that many models are not designed with the realities of the working learner in mind."
Human Capital Development,"Reimbursement models, for example, frontload costs on the learner while other company-sponsored plans use college access programs to move employees out rather than up."
Human Capital Development,"From the launch of LBU in 2018 and the end of January 2021, more than 44,000 Walmart associates have enrolled."
Human Capital Development,"More than 6,000 students have completed LBU programs, including over 320 graduates who have earned an associate or bachelor's degree in an in-demand field. At the end of 2020, our associates had completed 290,000 college credits worth more than an estimated $123 million."
Human Capital Development,Strengthening workforce development beyond Walmart
Human Capital Development,Talent is distributed equitably but often opportunity is not. The Walmart.org Economic Opportunity in Retail Initiative seeks to promote equitable advancement with a focus on America's frontline talent.
Human Capital Development,"Education beyond high school is key to increasing economic mobility, but more than half of American adults do not have a post-secondary degree."
Human Capital Development,"Through business and philanthropic initiatives, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have collaborated with leading non-profits, government agencies, education providers, key funders and other employers to create a movement around stronger learning systems for working adults and greater recognition of skills—including skills acquired through alternative learning models—in the workplace."
Human Capital Development,"Through this work, we are aiming for the equitable advancement of frontline workers."
Human Capital Development,Walmart supports workforce training and education policy efforts and actively engages in business collaboratives such as the Business Roundtable's Multiple Pathways Initiatives and Jobs for the Future's Recover Stronger initiative that are focused on building stronger career pathways for workers using skills as the currency for mobility.
Human Capital Development,"Since 2015, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have invested in organizations that work to create multiple pathways to equitable advancement for retail and other service sector workers who do not have college degrees. The initiative includes:"
Human Capital Development,Seeding and scaling innovative learning models for adult workers without college degrees so more people can access learning through work.
Human Capital Development,"For example, we have supported organizations like EdX's MicroBachelors program, the Claremont Graduate University Drucker Institute's Bendable initiative,  Merit America and Calbright College (an initiative of the Foundation for California Community Colleges), each of which have developed programs that connect people to effective upskilling."
Human Capital Development,Building a hiring and advancement system that can recognize and verify the skills people learn through alternative learning models.
Human Capital Development,Our grants to U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and to Credential Engine support the creation of standards and practices to verify and validate the skills people earned through alternative routes like on the job learning.
Human Capital Development,We are helping invest in a system that seeks to ensure skills are clearly articulated and transferrable across a person's career.
Human Capital Development,"Walmart.org is also engaging employers to adopt and implement equitable hiring and advancement practices that will drive greater career mobility. For example, our Center for Racial Equity includes a workstream that focuses on equity in education and the workforce."
Human Capital Development,"One of our initial investments is as a founding partner to OneTen, a coalition of leading executives who are coming together to upskill, hire and advance one million Black individuals in America over the next ten years into family-sustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement."
Human Capital Development,"Opportunity is not equally distributed across society, particularly along racial, ethnic, economic, gender and geographic lines."
Human Capital Development,"The economic and cultural environment favors traditional educational models over on-the-job education and skills development, and there is an immature market for cost-effective, practical tools to rapidly build skills among adult learners."
Human Capital Development,"Achievement of Walmart's workforce development aspirations is dependent on retailers and other similar businesses embracing the business case for frontline workforce development, as well as the concept of building skills through alternative routes gaining momentum in businesses and the effective engagement of associates in building capabilities relevant for advancement."
Human Capital Development,"Social science and economic philosophy are still developing on the most effective strategies for frontline workforce development at scale, and there are differences of opinion on what constitutes a good job and a fair and compelling associate value proposition. As a result, there are pressures for faster or more urgent action in certain aspects of Walmart's overall human capital strategy (e.g., base hourly wage) that may obscure the importance of other strategies that promote economic and career mobility (e.g., benefits, upskilling offering)."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart is subject to local, national, and international economic trends and realities. There is strong competition among employers for skilled, diverse workers, and labor surpluses and shortages can impact retail businesses. In the United States, the federal minimum wage currently creates downward pressure on wages in certain regions of the United States."
Human Capital Development,"Walmart's business is evolving rapidly. Customer trends towards omni-channel shopping, including pickup and delivery, change the skills necessary in Walmart's frontline workforce and may outpace incumbent associates' skills and readiness."
Human Capital Development, Its objective is to develop recruitment strategies that support the business needs and attract the best talent around the globe.
Human Capital Development,"The Company's recruitment process drives the candidate journey through all touchpoints, including sourcing activity, job postings, and communication throughout the application and interview process."
Human Capital Development,Some of the recruitment practices that the Company manages as a Global TA organization include:
Human Capital Development,"End-to-end hiring of interns, early career, professional, and executive positions for all business units."
Human Capital Development,"Job board management across various platforms (careers website, LinkedIn)."
Human Capital Development,University Programs to build its future workforce.
Human Capital Development,Lenovo Employer Value Proposition and employer branding.
Human Capital Development,Ongoing recruiter training and metrics to ensure candidate slates have diverse candidate representation.
Human Capital Development,Internships are a vital source for prospective candidates and a great way to strengthen the Company's culture.
Human Capital Development,"In 2020, the Company hired over 200 interns globally, providing meaningful learning experiences, mentor programs, innovation projects, and a view into a Global Fortune 500 technology Company. The size of this program was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic."
Human Capital Development,The Company partners with universities around the world to attract diverse talent.
Human Capital Development,"Its internship programs recruit tech enthusiasts and STEM program students from High School through Ph.D., which helps to build pipelines for potential hiring needs."
Human Capital Development,Some internship programs are specifically designed to help attract students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds to the Company.
Human Capital Development,The Company is dedicated to growing and developing a workforce to support its long-term growth.
Human Capital Development,"Early career hiring is a vital part of its human capital strategy. These programs include, but are not limited to:"
Human Capital Development,"The Company designs and implements competitive compensation programs to attract, motivate, and retain talent, including a mix of base pay and shortterm and long-term incentive plans. "
Human Capital Development,It routinely monitors and evaluates market trends and industry practices to ensure its compensation practices are competitive and react quickly to changes.
Human Capital Development,The Company invests heavily in industry-leading market surveys to ensure that its pay practices remain competitive.
Human Capital Development,The Company's compensation philosophy is to pay for performance.
Human Capital Development,It believes exceptional individual performance drives exceptional business performance and plays an important role in the payfor-performance philosophy.
Human Capital Development,Regular employees are bonus or commission eligible.
Human Capital Development,Its regular non-sales employees establish Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at the start of the fiscal year and managers are encouraged to review their performance against those objectives on a regular basis.
Human Capital Development,"At the end of the year, employees receive documented feedback on their performance and are rated accordingly. All regular non-sales employees receive an individual performance modifier (IPM) which impacts the bonus payment they are eligible to receive. Sales employees receive periodic quotas that impact their commission payments. Furthermore, sales quotas are reviewed and adjusted periodically as market conditions dictate."
Human Capital Development,This feedback may then be used by managers in making their year-end assessment.
Human Capital Development,The Company strives to create a supportive working environment for its employees around the world by giving them the flexibility to manage their unique life needs and their work.
Human Capital Development,"To ensure it can attract and retain high-quality talent in the competitive technology marketplace, the Company offers a variety of benefits for employees and their families. Benefits packages are developed with the following strategic guidelines:"
Human Capital Development,Position the Company competitively within the local marketplace.
Human Capital Development,Align with and support the Company's business and culture strategy.
Human Capital Development,Emphasize the Company's commitment to wellness and families.
Human Capital Development,"To achieve these goals, the Company must be flexible and consider varying customs, practices, legal requirements, and employee expectations around the world to design impactful benefits programs."
Human Capital Development,"The Company's Total Rewards approach consists of five elements: compensation; benefits; work-life balance; performance and recognition; and development and career opportunities. These five elements are critical in its ability to attract, motivate, and retain its most valuable strategic resource - its people."
Human Capital Development,"Globally, the Company offers flexible benefits in multiple markets and provide employees with a range of choices for benefits that fit their needs at various stages in their life. Choices vary by geography depending on the local market but often include the opportunity to add additional insurance coverage (life, disability, critical illness, dependent health care) or to purchase lifestyle-type benefits (pet insurance, home, or auto insurance) at discounted rates. "
Human Capital Development,"In the United States, the Company offers voluntary wellness programs that seek to improve employee health or prevent disease."
Human Capital Development,"The program is administered according to federal rules permitting employer-sponsored wellness programs, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as applicable, among others."
Human Capital Development,"The Company invests in talent development, taking a robust and systematic approach to employee management and executive development."
Human Capital Development,We combine these three training and development methods to maximize learning in a systematic approach:
Human Capital Development,Experiences on the Job - learning while doing. We design 70 percent of career development to happen on the job.
Human Capital Development,"Colleague Relationships - mentors, guides, coaches, managers."
Human Capital Development,We design for 20 percent of employee development through sharing their successes and failures with others and by seeking guidance and advice.
Human Capital Development,Education - formal training in the classroom or online that teaches key principles and skills.
Human Capital Development,We design 10 percent of our learning opportunities to be formal education.
Human Capital Development,"Employee training and development activities also include formal leadership education programs, targeted planning and global rotations, employee network forums, executive coaching, structured feedback, and a variety of assessments and development tools."
Human Capital Development,"The Company's new-hire training includes a combination of required instructor-led and online courses on the Code of Conduct, Information Security, Privacy Basics, and Global Inclusion training."
Human Capital Development,"The Global Learning and Development team has crafted a stair-step training approach that encompasses all levels of training from personal development, preparation for management, to manager and executive development."
Human Capital Development,These courses are delivered globally both in-person and virtually and are carefully designed around leadership priorities and behavior skills that support the Company's mission and vision.
Human Capital Development,"In FY 2020/21, the Company launched a new learning management system to better meet the needs of its employees."
Human Capital Development,"This new platform, which is still called Grow@Lenovo, hosts over 57,000 different online training assets, many of which are offered in eight different languages. The training platform also provides resources like free business books and GlobeSmart, a tool that supports cross-culture collaboration."
Human Capital Development,"The Company develops training content for sales, product, and process training, but also looks externally for other needed content, such as professional or technical skills training."
Human Capital Development,The Company is always looking for new ways to match business and employee development needs through licensing content from reputable external vendors.
Human Capital Development,"In addition to the mandatory compliance training for new hires, the Company also conducts regular compliance training campaigns."
Human Capital Development,"Last fiscal year, we saw a jump in our average training hours; some of this can be attributed to our Company-wide campaigns."
Human Capital Development,FY 2020/21 employee training metrics are available in the Consolidated Metrics section of this report.
Human Capital Development,"PepsiCo's workforce is bolstered by some of the best leaders and most effective associates in the industry, thanks in part to a global community of learning led by PepsiCo University."

Human Capital Development,"We compensate these hourly employees very well by retail standards. This helps us in the long run by minimizing turnover and enhancing employee productivity, commitment, and loyalty."
Human Capital Development,We encourage our employees to view Costco as a place where they can have a long-term career rather than just a job.
Human Capital Development,"In the U.S., we provide generous benefits, including affordable health care coverage for full- and part-time employees, and sizable contributions to company-sponsored retirement plans, based on years of service."
Human Capital Development,We provide twice-yearly Extra Checks (bonuses) for long-tenured hourly employees.

Human Capital Development,Micron and our stakeholders support the advancement of human rights along our value chain.
Human Capital Development,The Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics aligns with the RBA code of conduct and explicitly highlights our commitment to respecting and protecting human rights wherever we operate.
Human Capital Development,"Micron actively works to uphold the highest level of labor ethics in our own operations, and we also expect our suppliers, contractors and other partners to adhere to our code, human rights policy and relevant laws, with a particular emphasis on child labor and forced labor"
Human Capital Development,"Our commitment to these concerns is made public through our slavery and human trafficking statement, which was updated and approved by Micron's board of directors for FY20."
Human Capital Development,"As part of our ongoing due diligence in this area, we regularly conduct supplier risk assessments to understand how well suppliers address the issues, with specific focus on operations in areas more at risk for human rights violations."
Human Capital Development,"Beyond these important issues, Micron also monitors the following human rights concerns as they relate to our supply chain:"
Human Capital Development,"This oversight of human rights begins with anyone who works on a Micron site in any capacity, from security to construction work."
Human Capital Development,"It extends to the employees of our suppliers and to any people hired temporarily by suppliers, who in some parts of the world are foreign migrant workers."
Human Capital Development,"Many of Micron's suppliers are located in Asia, which has areas that are at higher risk for human rights violations against foreign migrant workers and require additional diligence."
Human Capital Development,"These fees can amount to more than several months' pay and may require workers to take out loans, effectively forcing them to pay to have a job."
Human Capital Development,"In addition, most of these workers send the majority of their earnings back to their home countries to support their families, making the payment of loans and fees especially burdensome."
Human Capital Development,"RBA code requirements limiting forced labor differ from the laws regarding fees, levies and working hours in many countries where we do business."
Human Capital Development,"While the variations add complexity, we enforce the more stringent standard if local laws and the RBA code are different."
Human Capital Development,"Micron is actively involved, along with other members of the RBA, in eliminating forced labor in our supply chain through training, dialogue with government officials and interviews with foreign migrant workers about their conditions."
Human Capital Development,We are an active member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA).

Human Capital Development,"Through RBA training materials, monitoring tools and third-party audits, we support the efforts of our key suppliers to maintain responsible operations."
Human Capital Development,We also hold suppliers accountable when they fall short of expectations.
Human Capital Development,"To comply with the RBA code in our own operations, we have adopted a vigorous management approach that includes training our team members on code requirements and using thirdparty auditors to verify our actions."
Human Capital Development,They monitor key RBA metrics across all of our manufacturing locations and review periodic reports on Micron's overall RBA performance.
Human Capital Development,"Using a ""learn and grow"" approach, we create an environment where team members and leaders are inspired to grow, empowered to learn and connected to resources and opportunities that nurture personal growth and performance."
Human Capital Development,We encourage them to choose their own development priorities and take initiative in using resources that Micron provides to advance their personal development.
Human Capital Development,Micron's primary program for assessing performance and promoting professional development is called Reach Performance.
Human Capital Development,"This program encourages higher levels of performance by establishing clear individual performance expectations, supporting team member development and enabling leaders to be better coaches."

Human Capital Development,"To promote Micron's goal of enabling the workforce of the future, we launched a new training platform, Micron University, to promote a growth mindset among all team members."

Human Capital Development,A skills advisory board assesses the offerings periodically to identify future skill needs and propose solutions for developing them in our workforce.
Human Capital Development,"We define feedback as observations of how team members perform at a specific point in time, coaching as an exercise in inquiry that helps them reach their potential, and mentoring as a sustained, organic relationship that can help clarify possible new career paths for team members."
Human Capital Development,"While we do not offer centralized programs around these types of team member interactions, we are building awareness of their power and allowing business functions to develop opportunities that best suit them."
Human Capital Development,"For example, we recently launched a virtual coaching platform for a small subset of leaders and developed a course on impact coaching."
Human Capital Development,"A training course on best practices for evaluating performance was delivered to more than 5,000 global leaders."
Human Capital Development,We offer a common mentoring playbook that is used across all our professional development possibilities.
Human Capital Development,"That handbook, accessible by all team members, is available in English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Malay."
Human Capital Development,"To promote collaboration across teams, Micron uses the Emergenetics tool, which encourages team members to actively embrace diversity of thought and behaviors."
Human Capital Development,"Since this tool was introduced, more than 14,400 leaders and team members have received their customized profiles."
Human Capital Development,"Our strategy to create a sustainable world includes uplifting our people, culture, and communities."
Human Capital Development,"At Trane Technologies, we strive to create a working environment where our team members can grow and advance, and we want our workforce to hold an optimistic vision for their future."

Human Capital Development,We offer market-competitive benefits to team members in every country in which we operate.
Human Capital Development,"In some localities, we offer differentiated programs that often exceed regulated requirements."
Human Capital Development,"For example, in addition to the paid maternity leave provided through the Family and Medical Leave Act in the U.S., we offer paid leave for four additional weeks to eligible birth mothers."
Human Capital Development,"In addition, the program offers birth fathers, adoptive parents, secondary care givers, foster parents, and parents of a surrogate child two weeks of paid leave."

Human Capital Development,Different perspectives are key to finding solutions to complex global challenges.
Human Capital Development,Ørsted IN - our employee-driven inclusion networks - plays an instrumental role in building a culture where it is both encouraged and safe for everyone to speak up and bring their whole self to work.
Human Capital Development,"Achieving diversity in an organisation is difficult, especially in industries that have traditionally attracted and hired employees belonging to certain demographics."
Human Capital Development,"And if you have a diverse organisation, it will only last and bring value if you also have a culture that is inclusive of that diversity - so that everyone, no matter their background or demographics, can contribute, thrive, perform, and grow."
Human Capital Development,"At Ørsted, our employees are a key driver in building a culture that supports exactly that."
Human Capital Development,"In 2016, a small women's networking group developed into our first employee-driven inclusion network."
Human Capital Development,"Since then, the Ørsted IN networks have significantly bolstered our inclusion work."
Human Capital Development,"Today, there are globally connected regional networks addressing gender, LGBTQ+, disability, and race & ethnicity."
Human Capital Development,"With over 1,000 active partici- We still have work to do in reassuring people and telling them it's safe to come out Bringing your whole self to work isn't an end-goal - it's a starting point 35 % of the LGBTQ+ workforce in the UK disguise or hide their identity at work Building a culture where we can all thrive But it's not just a social club; we want to have a real impact on recruitment, retention, benefits, and employee engagement. Intersectionality will be key to that - we need to ensure the conversation isn't dominated by cis-gender, white, or male voices, even in the LGBTQ+ groups. To that end, the LGBTQ+ group is working with the Race & Ethnicity group to think harder about how we can help Ørsted recruit a more diverse set of colleagues. The North America team is growing rapidly, so what we do now will determine the office culture for years to come. We can't miss that opportunity. I eventually found strength in embracing my 'onlyness', and with the mentorship of my managers, I was able to out myself at work. It's been a really positive experience; I've received such a positive attitude from people around the business. I want others to know that it can bring you so much strength, if you want to do it. Yet, it's a learning journey. We need to better understand who our workforce community is. Through collection and analysis of anonymous diversity data, we can tell if we're representative of the communities we operate in, which groups represent the majority, and which might be under-represented. Crucially, it can tell us if our initiatives have impact and aid our understanding of where further action is needed. Ørsted's commitment to inclusivity adds another layer of meaning to a company involved in green energy and sustainability. The culture we create internally should be a reflection of the values we hope to preserve and practise in the world. While progress has been made, it will be increasingly challenging to continue efforts to practise inclusivity in a meaningful way as Ørsted grows as a global organisation. pants and sponsorship from senior leaders, they contribute to making diversity a company-wide dialogue and to making Ørsted a workplace where employees can feel comfortable bringing their whole selves to work, wherever they are in our global community."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, we were corporate partners to WorldPride Copenhagen, and during the week, we celebrated by putting spotlight on the value and challenges of inclusion. We had an internal virtual conversation where we asked our LGBTQ+ networks to share their experiences of inclusivity at Ørsted. Here is what four representatives had to say about what they feel is working, and where we still have work to do."
Human Capital Development,"While I've never been openly discriminated against at Ørsted, I've felt significant anxiety around how colleagues might respond to who I really am"
Human Capital Development,"There was little visibility around inclusion when I joined, and without those signals, you hold back elements of your life."
Human Capital Development,"Yet, it's a learning journey. We need to better understand who our workforce community is."
Human Capital Development,"I've had a positive experience at Ørsted from the getgo. I talked about my husband on my first calls with colleagues, and no one batted an eyelash; it wasn't an issue. Just as I was wondering if there was an LGBTQ+ group, the Ørsted IN initiative launched. It really helped me establish a sense of community and meet colleagues I wouldn't otherwise have interacted with."
Human Capital Development,"But it's not just a social club; we want to have a real impact on recruitment, retention, benefits, and employee engagement."
Human Capital Development,"Intersectionality will be key to that - we need to ensure the conversation isn't dominated by cis-gender, white, or male voices, even in the LGBTQ+ groups."
Human Capital Development,"To that end, the LGBTQ+ group is working with the Race & Ethnicity group to think harder about how we can help Ørsted recruit a more diverse set of colleagues."
Human Capital Development,"The North America team is growing rapidly, so what we do now will determine the office culture for years to come"
Human Capital Development,We can't miss that opportunity
Human Capital Development,I'm heartened and inspired to hear other Ørsted employees say they've seen a progressive shift towards a culture that actively engages and practises LGBTQ+ inclusion.
Human Capital Development,"It does make a real positive difference to host events which encourage people to be curious, open-minded, and think about these things more deeply - especially in a place like Malaysia, where anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment is still so prevalent."
Human Capital Development,Ørsted's commitment to inclusivity adds another layer of meaning to a company involved in green energy and sustainability.
Human Capital Development,"While progress has been made, it will be increasingly challenging to continue efforts to practise inclusivity in a meaningful way as Ørsted grows as a global organisation."
Human Capital Development,"I kept playing out scenarios in my head in case the question of partners ever came up - trying to work out how to handle it, how to deflect it."
Human Capital Development,"I eventually found strength in embracing my 'onlyness', and with the mentorship of my managers, I was able to out myself at work."
Human Capital Development,It's been a really positive experience; I've received such a positive attitude from people around the business.
Human Capital Development,"I want others to know that it can bring you so much strength, if you want to do it."
Human Capital Development,"As global competition for the best talent grows, businesses must improve the development and retention of existing talent and engage new diverse talent globally"
Human Capital Development,Creating a work environment where all employees thrive and are motivated to help create a sustainable business is essential for sustaining long-term value creation.

Human Capital Development,"We provide global digital and in-person learning opportunities for all employees, both through our learning platform and through programmes tailored to specific business areas and geographies. Learning opportunities are easy to use, scalable, individualised, and transparent, and drive business outcomes."
Human Capital Development,"We have aligned, globalised, and increased the headcount in our Learning & Talent Development and Diversity & Talent teams to increase our in-house support for this agenda."
Human Capital Development,"We ran our second virtual Global Learning Week focusing on two of our six core capabilities. Globally, more than 20 % of employees attended virtual sessions led by internal and external speakers"

Human Capital Development,"In 2020, we achieved 100% pay equity for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States."
Human Capital Development,We are committed to maintaining this goal going forward.
Human Capital Development,"At American Express, we strive to treat everyone who works for us fairly and equally."
Human Capital Development,"We have a longstanding commitment to pay all colleagues equitably and maintain bias-free, transparent compensation practices, and we are proud of our leadership in this area."
Human Capital Development,"Our compensation practices reward colleagues based on performance and other business-related criteria for all roles and levels, and we have policies and processes in place to compensate all colleagues fairly and free of biases."
Human Capital Development,"We review these practices regularly, and since 2017 we have also worked each year with independent experts to conduct a pay equity review."
Human Capital Development,"Since 2019, this analysis has covered our entire global colleague base across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the US, assessing pay on a statistical basis and considering key factors that influence compensation, including but not limited to tenure, role, level, geography, and performance."
Human Capital Development,"In the past, we aimed to achieve pay ""parity""—meaning to the point of statistical insignificance—to ensure colleagues are paid fairly, relative to one another."
Human Capital Development,"In 2019, we reached that goal, making salary adjustments in targeted areas where needed."
Human Capital Development,"Although pay parity is a meaningful achievement, we wanted to set an even higher standard for ourselves: to reach 100% pay ""equity""—meaning no statistical differences—for all genders globally, as well as for colleagues of all races and ethnicities in the US."
Human Capital Development,"In 2020, we invested in all necessary and appropriate salary adjustments to reach our goal of 100% pay equity."
Human Capital Development,We are proud of this achievement and are committed to maintaining this goal going forward.
Human Capital Development,"This metric compares differences in raw median base pay making no adjustments for factors such as role, level, tenure, performance, or geography."
Human Capital Development,"In 2020, the median pay for women globally at American Express was 107.6% of the median pay for men, and the median pay for US racially/ethnically diverse colleagues was 94.6% of that for white colleagues."
Human Capital Development,We believe our pay equity review provides a more accurate and comprehensive picture of our compensation practices overall because it provides a more granular view that considers many important factors known to affect an individual's compensation.
Human Capital Development,"For this reason, we use pay equity as the standard we hold ourselves accountable to in order to confirm that our compensation practices and reward structure are free of bias."
Human Capital Development,We remain committed to maintaining 100% pay equity for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the US by continuing our annual pay equity review process going forward.
Human Capital Development,Diversity makes our business stronger.
Human Capital Development,"We have processes in place to recruit diverse candidates worldwide, including women, minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities."
Human Capital Development,"In 2020 and 2021, we further strengthened our efforts to attract top talent and deliver the best candidate experience, including educating leaders about inclusive hiring and interview practices to help minimize inherent bias, and providing our recruiters, interviewers and hiring leaders with the tools and resources they need to build and access a diverse slate of candidates and practice inclusive hiring."

Human Capital Development,"Since FY2010, the MC Group Gateway Program has been conducted as an orientation program for employees of MC's offices and group companies worldwide."
Human Capital Development,"Held in Tokyo eight times per year in Japanese and English, the program's objectives are to encourage employees to share MC's corporate principles and values, and to foster a greater understanding of the MC Group."
Human Capital Development,"In the year ended March 2020, about 450 employees took part, bringing the total number of participants since the program's inception to roughly 4,100."
Human Capital Development,Similar orientation programs to share MC Group values are being held in other regions.
Human Capital Development,"In recent years, we have been transferring more employees hired at MC overseas offices to other countries to meet the growing needs of our global operations."
Human Capital Development,These international transfers provide a wide range of experiences and help to refine employees' global perspectives.
Human Capital Development,"At the same time, they give employees a clearer understanding of the MC Group overall and its management philosophy."
Human Capital Development,"MC will therefore continue to promote deployments on a consolidated, global base, assigning the appropriate human resources for each position."
Human Capital Development,"We take a design-thinking, systems-based, customer-centric approach to building the employee experience at Recursion."
Human Capital Development,"Throughout the employee experience we create moments, tools, systems and more that drive belonging, growth and impact."
Human Capital Development,From candidate to alumni we consider how we deliver benefit and how we inspire our people to do the best work of their lives.
Human Capital Development,These three related benefits are central to the experience of being a Recursionaut.
Human Capital Development,"Importantly, we invest in people managers who also play a pivotal role in bringing these employee benefits to life."
Human Capital Development,"We employ a targeted approach to identify, attract and hire employees across highly-technical scientific disciplines including: biology, chemistry, data science, machine learning, engineering, robotics, clinical development and more."
Human Capital Development,Our efforts are spearheaded by an experienced internal recruiting team and supplemented by specialized external recruiting partners who act as subject matter experts to recruit in-demand talent.
Human Capital Development,"Recursionauts join because of our mission, science, technology and culture."
Human Capital Development,"We have employed creative means to identify and recruit some of the brightest minds, including hosting a machine learning competition based on the release of our public dataset, RxRx1, in affiliation with NeurIPS, a premier Artificial Intelligence (AI) conference."
Human Capital Development,"We also leverage social media, scientific job posting boards and referrals."
Human Capital Development,"In June 2021, we announced our expansion into Canada because of its diverse and brilliant talent networks across technology, biology and chemistry."
Human Capital Development,"We look forward to partnering with a multicultural community and participating in the Toronto and Montréal ecosystems where there are remarkable collaborations between industry, government and academia."
Human Capital Development,The inherent complexity and evolution of the Recursion Operating System results in value being placed on the institutional knowledge that comes with time at Recursion.
Human Capital Development,Part of the value proposition of being a Recursionaut is that our employees' careers will grow.
Human Capital Development,"Upon employment, a comprehensive, 13-session Onboarding Learning Series is provided for each new employee, which is facilitated by leaders throughout the company and focused on accelerating their time to impact."
Human Capital Development,"Additionally, we host a two-day off-site for new hires called Decoding Recursion, which is focused on accelerating a deep understanding of our Values and instilling a sense of belonging."
Human Capital Development,"The Decoding Recursion experience is designed around storytelling and activities facilitated by senior leaders, including regular attendance by our Co-Founder and CEO."
Human Capital Development,"Belonging is closely tied to psychological safety, which we believe is an essential element for collaborative work environments."
Human Capital Development,"We also believe that shortening the time until employees feel belonging and impact leads to increased engagement, productivity and retention."
Human Capital Development,"Culturally, we instill an expectation that we should all be learning and growing as fast as Recursion."
Human Capital Development,"Programmatically, our Goals & Grow System is the year-round system that creates employee accountability for delivering goals, learning and living our values."
Human Capital Development,"When we write our quarterly goals, self-reviews or manager reviews, we ask ""What will be/was delivered? What will be/was learned? How will/did this person impact others?"" From there, employees and managers have the expectation, and latitude, to create learning and development plans for their learning goals through stretch assignments, special projects, mentorship and internal and external programs."
Human Capital Development,"Internally, we offer a variety of training and development programs."
Human Capital Development,"Topics include introductory and advanced series of manager fundamentals, workshops on adaptivity and resilience, behaviors of inclusion, and inclusive hiring."
Human Capital Development,"Additionally we offer leadership development through The Leadership Consortium (TLC), which helps best-in-class organizations create the conditions for all leaders to thrive."
Human Capital Development,We piloted two cohorts of the leadership program and had a 90% participation rate across the company in 2021.
Human Capital Development,"Lastly, we offer coaching programs through a third-party firm that provides personalized, comprehensive coaching experiences — driving whole person growth and sustained organizational outcomes."
Human Capital Development,Sixty-five employees participated in 2021.
Human Capital Development,We also offer a specific parental leave coaching program for parents navigating the transition dynamics of work both pre- and post-leave.
Human Capital Development,"Additional ways we foster development at Recursion include journal clubs, code review, paired programming and more."
Human Capital Development,"Our journal clubs consist of interdisciplinary discussions of recent journal publications in the realm of chemistry, data science, and more."
Human Capital Development,"This group exemplifies One Recursion as they discuss different potential applications, both short-term and long-term here at Recursion."
Human Capital Development,"Throughout development in our tech functions, team members are paired with someone familiar with our systems for code review and paired programming, and they pair on the solutions so they can understand the code base of our products."
Human Capital Development,"We aim to ensure employees are seen, heard and celebrated through many practices."
Human Capital Development,"All Hands meetings are held weekly, including from our non-HQ sites, and hosted by senior leaders to emphasize transparency."
Human Capital Development,"We aim to be 'unscripted', to say the hard things when needed, and to laugh together as much as possible."
Human Capital Development,"We celebrate results with a ""Quarterly Wins"" ritual, where nominated teams share their story."
Human Capital Development,Kudos is our recognition and gratitude program in which employees can give each other points for helping with a project or demonstrating a core value.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, 50% of our workforce participated in Kudos with nearly 8,000 Kudos messages sent."
Human Capital Development,"Donut is our tool for connecting Recursionauts from different functional areas for informal, 1:1 meetings."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, 140 Recursionauts participated in the program, making a total of 675 connections with new colleagues."
Human Capital Development,"When on-site at Headquarters, we eat together at our onsite kitchen, lovingly and jokingly named 'High-Throughput Feeding.'"
Human Capital Development,"By eating together and knowing one another, we create belonging and engagement across functions and throughout the company."
Human Capital Development,We aim to replicate this in all our sites while taking into account the size of the team and local challenges and opportunities.
Human Capital Development,"Depending on function and performance, many employees are afforded flexibility to work from home up to 60% of the time."
Human Capital Development,Recursion covers all travel.
Human Capital Development,"We also aim to invite employees from other sites and who work remotely to attend off-sites and employee celebrations at HQ, and cover travel and lodging for both employees and a partner in certain circumstances."
Human Capital Development,"Engagement, akin to motivation, is an industry standard index score that research shows is a driver of performance and business results."
Human Capital Development,We measure engagement using an industry standard index of five questions on a favorability scale.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, with 93% participation, we scored 86% favorability on the engagement index company-wide, which is more than 11 points higher than the Technology, Science and Research benchmark* of many similarly positioned companies."
Human Capital Development,"In 2020, our engagement score was 83%, with 91% participation."
Human Capital Development,"Over-indexing on engagement above 85% could come at the cost of delivering for other stakeholders in the business such as our partners, shareholders or the patients we aim to serve."
Human Capital Development,97% of employees said they are proud to work at Recursion in 2021.
Human Capital Development,"We're proud of our consistently low turnover rates, which are well below industry average."
Human Capital Development,"In turn, our low turnover rates demonstrate their investment in Recursion's growth."
Human Capital Development,"A main cultural value embedded within our organization is One Recursion, where every discipline works together toward better cumulative solutions."
Human Capital Development,"We live this value during Hack Week, an annual company-wide week of solving challenges and working cross-functionally across the organization."
Human Capital Development,"We minimize all non-essential commitments (e.g. regular meetings) at the company for this week to help teams focus on exploring, learning, connecting and building."
Human Capital Development,"By not limiting participation to traditional ""tech"" employees, we foster innovation and collaboration by instead encouraging all employees to join in the challenge and self-select their project for the week."
Human Capital Development,"Nearly a dozen projects were implemented in production immediately following Hack Week 2021, while others have spawned new ideas and led to quarterly goals that we otherwise would not have identified."
Human Capital Development,A 2019 Hack Week project led to savings of millions of dollars in new capex spend and significantly improved throughput of our automated laboratory.
Human Capital Development,"Hack Week provides a unique opportunity to learn and explore, including in areas that individuals may not have been familiar with previously."
Human Capital Development,"To take a look at sample Hack week projects, please visit our website: https://www.recursion.com/news/hack-week"
Human Capital Development,"At JPMorgan Chase, our people drive our success in serving our customers, clients and communities."
Human Capital Development,"Our human capital strategy is focused on attracting, developing and retaining the diverse talent we need to advance our business today and into the future."
Human Capital Development,"We invest across the employee life cycle - from recruiting and employee development to engagement, compensation and benefits - to build a diverse team and inclusive culture where our employees across the globe are welcomed, valued and able to bring their full selves and best work forward."
Human Capital Development,We strive to attract and recruit the best talent for all roles across the Firm.
Human Capital Development,"Our goal is to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce reflective of the communities we serve, and we are focused on hiring talent with a wide range of characteristics - including diversity related to gender, ethnicity, military service, LGBT+ status and disabilities, as well as diverse perspectives and skill sets."
Human Capital Development,"To find and select a diverse pool of talented candidates, we are committed to sourcing from underrepresented communities and establishing strategic partnerships and programs to create new pathways for candidates with less traditional backgrounds."
Human Capital Development,Diverse slates are an important consideration in our comprehensive recruiting efforts and are tracked and monitored by the Firm.
Human Capital Development,"In hiring new employees, managers and recruiters are expected to consider a diverse slate of candidates. Diverse slates are defined - in the U.S. - as no less than one woman and one ethnically diverse candidate (defined as Equal Employment Opportunity Commission classifications other than White) and - outside the U.S. - as including no less than one woman."
Human Capital Development,A robust pipeline of diverse talent at entry levels is essential to creating a representative workforce - and ensuring our Firm has access to a broad pool of talent to meet our long-term needs.
Human Capital Development,"We have a competitive recruiting program which includes summer internships, apprenticeships and full-time hiring."
Human Capital Development,We focus on expanding diversity in our traditional internship programs and operate more than 70 Emerging Talent Programs globally that specifically focus on recruiting people who are often underrepresented in typical talent channels.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, we expanded our partnerships with HBCUs across the U.S., with a focus on deepening our campus and hiring pipeline relationships, as well as supporting student development and financial health programs for long-term student success (see page 37)."
Human Capital Development,"As one part of this, we launched the J.P. Morgan Wealth Management HBCU Scholarship Program for students interested in the financial planning profession."
Human Capital Development,Students receiving the scholarship will gain access to two summer internship experiences: the Advancing Black Pathways Fellowship Program (see page 37) and the J.P.
Human Capital Development,Morgan Wealth Management Service Center Internship.
Human Capital Development,"Upon completion, students will also be eligible for an additional scholarship to be applied to their senior year."
Human Capital Development,"Additionally, in 2021, J.P. Morgan Wealth Management set a target to hire 300 additional Black and Latino advisors by 2025 through a combination of scholarships, internships, mentoring experiences and internal mobility efforts."
Human Capital Development,"Through this program, J.P. Morgan Wealth Management plans to award 75 scholarships annually over the next five years, as well as provide training and licensing support."
Human Capital Development,"Our pipeline programs are focused not just on who we might hire today, but also on helping young people develop the skills and experience that will enable them to compete for jobs at our Firm - and others - when they enter the workforce in the future."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, we engaged approximately 7,400 participants through these Future Pipeline programs."
Human Capital Development,"These programs offer young people exposure to professions and skills relevant to our Firm, provide broad opportunities for skills development and help students be better prepared for recruiting processes at our Firm and similar ones."
Human Capital Development,"In May 2021, we launched a ""Girls Who Code Work Prep"" program to introduce participants to careers at JPMorgan Chase."
Human Capital Development,"Of 50 young women who participated, more than half went on to apply to a 2022 internship at our Firm."
Human Capital Development,"We also launched the Think Ahead program in 2021, which offers high school students a chance to experience financial career options at our London office, with a particular focus on recruiting students from a low-income background into the program."
Human Capital Development,Helping our employees advance their skills and professional development is important to our human capital strategy.
Human Capital Development,"We invest in our employees' development through a robust suite of training, leadership development, upskilling and reskilling programs, mentorship initiatives and performance evaluations."
Human Capital Development,We train our employees with the skills needed for today and tomorrow.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, employees completed over 10 million courses and over eight million hours of training."
Human Capital Development,"Training efforts include mandatory curricula for new hires and existing employees, along with a range of programs focused on topics from leadership development and technology to risk and compliance and business processes."
Human Capital Development,"All employees are required to take annual training on our Code of Conduct (see page 57), as well as courses related to DEI, anti-money laundering, privacy and data protection, cybersecurity and anti-corruption."
Human Capital Development,"Our global leadership development Center of Excellence, Leadership Edge, is focused on creating one leadership culture and helping managers become better leaders every day."
Human Capital Development,"More than 100,000 leaders and managers have participated since the program launched in 2015, including 14,000 in 2021."
Human Capital Development,"We also continued to expand the Manager Excellence framework, which defines effective and inclusive leadership."
Human Capital Development,"This includes designing learning specifically tailored to manager capabilities, such as driving performance, prioritizing diversity, equity & inclusion and guiding careers."
Human Capital Development,Upskilling and reskilling our existing employees - who already know our culture and are committed to our company - is an effective and efficient way to have the talent we need to compete and thrive now and into the future.
Human Capital Development,"Just as importantly, it is one of the best ways we can advance our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion."
Human Capital Development,"For example, our Firm's front-line and entry-level employees, whose roles are most likely to be affected by technological disruption, disproportionately identify as women and diverse employees."
Human Capital Development,"By taking proactive steps to create meaningful and accessible opportunities for career mobility, we can mitigate the risk of losing legacy talent, and continue our efforts towards a more diverse and representative workforce."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, approximately one-third of all positions were filled with internal candidates, including nearly 30% of seniorlevel positions."
Human Capital Development,"In order to help employees understand the skills they need to advance their careers at the Firm, and identify relevant training opportunities, we expanded communication of skill requirements for over 350 Technology, Operations and Branch job profiles covering over half of our employees."
Human Capital Development,We also offer programs to help employees develop tailored learning journeys based on aspirational roles in their career development plans.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, these learning journeys were made available for approximately 42,000 employees."
Human Capital Development,We further support employee development with education benefits.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, JPMorgan Chase expanded these offerings in North America with access to over 400 bachelors, masters and certification programs, as well as partnering with our education providers to deliver programs that are designed to prepare employees for new jobs in growing roles at the Firm."
Human Capital Development,"Of the nearly 6,000 employees in North America who enrolled in our education benefits in 2021, 76% are associate level or below, 51% are women, 58% identify as ethnically diverse and 23% of participants had already experienced upward career growth during the year."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, we also continued to maintain a focus on our talent management and succession planning process."
Human Capital Development,"The human resources team actively engages with senior leaders to discuss key talent, internal succession and the development of our leadership pipeline."
Human Capital Development,"We use an annual Firmwide performance review process to help employees grow and to evaluate how they support our culture, business success and employee engagement and development."
Human Capital Development,"Employees are assessed across four core dimensions: business results; client, customer and stakeholder; teamwork and leadership; and risks, controls and conduct."
Human Capital Development,Providing a first-class employee experience is important to our human capital strategy.
Human Capital Development,"This includes engaging our employees in strengthening our culture and business, and listening and responding to their experiences and ideas."
Human Capital Development,We also support employees' drive to help strengthen their communities by facilitating skills-based volunteering opportunities.
Human Capital Development,"Our annual employee engagement survey, the results of which are reviewed by senior leadership for potential program improvements, was expanded to have a deeper focus on inclusion."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, 87% of employees participated in this survey."
Human Capital Development,"Through skills-based volunteering programs, we support our employees' desire to help their communities and further our philanthropic mission, while providing opportunities for them to apply and expand their skills."
Human Capital Development,Service Corps engaged more than 275 employees globally in 2021 to address specific organizational challenges and opportunities for nonprofits.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, 332 JPMorgan Chase employees used their skills to help small business owners grow their businesses and networks."
Human Capital Development,A similar program deploys employees to support minority-led small businesses through the Founders Forward program.
Human Capital Development,"In addition, our career mentorship programs have allowed us to connect more than 1,200 employees with youth, helping to set them on a path toward future career endeavors."
Human Capital Development,"Finally, serving on a nonprofit board is one of the most significant commitments our employees make."
Human Capital Development,Our Board Service program has trained and placed more than 110 employees on nonprofit boards across the U.S. in the last year.
Human Capital Development,"In addition, our Board Match program has provided financial support to nonprofits with qualifying employees serving on the board."
Human Capital Development,Another of our social innovation and skill-based volunteerism programs is Force for Good which connects team of JPMorgan Chase technology and data employees to build scalable and sustainable tech-based solutions for nonprofits around the world.
Human Capital Development,"Through this program, we empower our employees to use their technology skills to make a positive impact on communities and help build the next generation of technology talent."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, almost 1,300 JPMorgan Chase employees built tech-based solutions for approximately 200 nonprofits across five global regions, impacting more than one million constituents and addressing issues including hunger, access to education, lack of shelter, animal welfare, climate change and gender rights."
Human Capital Development,BRGs are one way we engage and support our employees in helping us build a diverse and equitable culture in which everyone feels welcome (see page 27).
Human Capital Development,"We have 10 BRGs with employee members across 54 countries, and approximately 48% of our employees are a member of at least one BRG."
Human Capital Development,They include:
Human Capital Development,"Maximizing the contributions of employees affected by disabilities, longterm illness or care giving responsibilities."
Human Capital Development,Empowering Hispanic and Latino employees to identify and pursue opportunities for career development and community involvement.
Human Capital Development,Enhancing the professional development and leadership opportunities of employees of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage.

Human Capital Development,Identifying and advocating for opportunities that will keep the Firm as an industry leader while deepening its commitment to veteran families.
Human Capital Development,"Providing a collaborative forum and access to tools that support the successful retention, development and advancement of women at all levels of the Firm."
Human Capital Development,Promoting knowledge sharing and providing networking opportunities to support employees with work and family integration; open to all employees in EMEA and APAC.
Human Capital Development,"In addition to BRGs, we have seven dedicated Centers of Excellence that drive programs and initiatives to strengthen our internal culture of inclusion and raise the visibility of our communities."
Human Capital Development,"The Centers of Excellence include Advancing Black Pathways, Advancing Hispanics and Latinos, Military and Veterans Affairs, Office of Asian & Pacific Islander Affairs, Office of Disability Inclusion, Office of LGBT+ Affairs, and Women on the Move (see page 27)."
Human Capital Development,"Our compensation and benefits programs focus on supporting the needs of our employees and their families, promoting employee well-being and engagement and building our culture of inclusion and equity."
Human Capital Development,Our compensation philosophy provides the guiding principles that drive compensation-related decisions across all levels of the Firm.
Human Capital Development,"We believe our compensation philosophy promotes an equitable and well-governed approach to compensation, which includes pay-for-performance practices that attract and retain top talent in a competitive market, is responsive to and aligned with shareholders, reinforces our culture and Business Principles and integrates risk, controls and conduct considerations."
Human Capital Development,"We offer extensive benefits and wellness packages to our employees and their families, including health care coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, on-site health and wellness centers, employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup childcare arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, mental health counseling and support, financial coaching, and more."
Human Capital Development,"We direct our benefits spend toward lower-wage earners, including providing higher insurance subsidies and lower deductibles in the medical plan and a $750 special award in 2021 to employees earning less than $60,000."
Human Capital Development,We are committed to equitable compensation for our employees.
Human Capital Development,We conduct periodic pay equity reviews covering employees at all levels within the Firm.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, taking into account factors such as an employee's role, tenure, seniority and geography, in aggregate, those who self identified as women globally were paid 99% of what men were paid."
Human Capital Development,"In the U.S., ethnically diverse employees who self-identified as other than White under EEO Commission classifications, were paid as a group comparably to what White employees were paid, taking into account factors such as an employee's role, tenure, seniority and geography."
Human Capital Development,"Pay equity reviews give us important insights, but they are just a starting point."
Human Capital Development,"Where appropriate, we take action to address it."
Human Capital Development,"If we identify individuals with compensation that is less than expected, we dig deeper."
Human Capital Development,We are proud of the overall diversity of our workforce.
Human Capital Development,"However, we also know that women and ethnically diverse employees still are not represented in as many senior management positions as are men and White employees."
Human Capital Development,"We are taking a variety of actions focused on hiring, retaining, developing and advancing women and ethnically diverse employees, especially at more senior levels."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, we launched Morgan Health, a new business unit, to help innovate and improve employer-sponsored healthcare."
Human Capital Development,The U.S. health care system continues to fall short of meeting expectations.
Human Capital Development,"Health care costs continue to rise -average premiums for family coverage have increased 22% since 2016- for both employers and employees, with no evidence that outcomes are improving."
Human Capital Development,"Only 46% of adults with private insurance have their blood pressure controlled, and that number has declined in the last 10 years."
Human Capital Development,"Morgan Health has an opportunity to deliver and scale new healthcare models that improve the quality, equity and affordability of employer-sponsored healthcare and is focused on connecting health care to improved health outcomes for our employees."
Human Capital Development,"To do so, Morgan Health is investing $250 million to accelerate the development and delivery of accountable care, completing in 2021 its first $50 million investment in Vera Whole Health (which subsequently merged with Castlight) with plans to deploy these services to our employees in Columbus, Ohio, in 2022."
Human Capital Development,"Morgan Health completed another investment in health care analytics company Embold Health in March 2022, which will help facilitate how consumers access the highest-quality care available."
Human Capital Development,"We are also working toward providing equal access to equal healthcare, regardless of race, income or other personal characteristics for our employees and in the communities we serve."
Human Capital Development,"Addressing inequities in health care is fundamental to Morgan Health's strategy, and through our work with Kaiser Permanente in California, we are moving forward quickly on a collaborative effort focused on the collection and reporting of health equity performance metrics."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, we continued to update and enhance safety protocols and support based on evolving best practices and employee needs."
Human Capital Development,A key area of focus was supporting employees in getting vaccinated.
Human Capital Development,"Since 2021, we have facilitated the delivery of over 70,000 vaccine and/or booster doses to employees and their families globally."
Human Capital Development,"To further support employees in getting vaccinated, we provided eight additional hours of paid time off for employees to get initial vaccines and four hours of additional paid time off for vaccine booster shots."
Human Capital Development,"These events, developed in partnership with our Business Resource Groups, brought in diverse speakers to help address vaccine hesitancy in various communities and populations."
Human Capital Development,We also ran an educational campaign featuring 15 events with over 30 medical doctors and industry experts who discussed the importance of vaccines and addressed employee questions.
Human Capital Development,"Throughout the pandemic, we made COVID-19 diagnostic tests more accessible and available at no cost to U.S. employees and their eligible dependents by offering at-home self-administered tests, plus onsite and near-site testing options in select locations."
Human Capital Development,We continued to adapt and expand mental health and well-being support for employees in response to the increased stresses caused by the pandemic including hosting virtual forums with mental health clinicians.
Human Capital Development,"We continue to amplify our investments in our people, as each person's individual growth and evolution contributes to our collective strength."
Human Capital Development,"At Stanley Black & Decker, across our global enterprise, we are working to create immersive and equitable employee experiences animated by our socially and emotionally intelligent culture of belonging—for productive, collaborative and shared excellence."
Human Capital Development,"Recognizing that talent is a competitive advantage, we are investing in building a talent pipeline and a differentiated people experience."
Human Capital Development,"Unlocking the synergies of people and technology, we are democratizing training and development with AI-powered platforms and tools—all with the goal of giving our people more power over their work and personal growth trajectories."
Human Capital Development,Empowerment stems from measuring employee engagement in meaningful ways.
Human Capital Development,We assess engagement at the team level through surveys and engagement tools and work with leaders to support the needs of a highly engaged workforce.
Human Capital Development,We prioritize connecting our people across businesses and geographies through social collaboration tools like Workplace by Meta.
Human Capital Development,"This tool has been especially meaningful during the pandemic to bring timely visibility to business priorities, ensure the health and safety of our employees and give our people access to important resources—and each other—in ways that improve productivity and keep people engaged."
Human Capital Development,"Our learning platform, DeepHow delivers on-demand visual training, a digital resource for the workplace on how things get done and how to do them right."
Human Capital Development,"This powerful efficiency tool enables centralized operations training and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) documentation, with efficient content creation and a tracking and skills matrix, for scalable best practices and communications as well as knowledge risk mitigation."
Human Capital Development,"An investment in the democratization of training and development, DeepHow supports multiple languages and features easy-to-navigate video segmentation and tools for sharing and tracking for individuals and teams."
Human Capital Development,"Based on DeepHow's success with our people, we are expanding its use and integrating it into onboarding and mandatory safety training."
Human Capital Development,"We approach our internal talent as a marketplace for developing skills, deploying talent and mobilizing careers."
Human Capital Development,We are working to establish an AI-enabled talent ecosystem to match internal skills and spare capacity with business projects and tasks.
Human Capital Development,"This will create more career paths, accelerate the rate of learning, fill critical roles at a faster rate and reduce the overall cost of labor."
Human Capital Development,"Accelerated by the pandemic, we have entered a new era of work where business resiliency demands flexibility."
Human Capital Development,"Enabled by advanced technology with ubiquitous connectivity and collaboration, we are moving toward a hybrid of virtual and in-person experiences, especially within our offices but also reaching to the Advanced Manufacturing factory floor"
Human Capital Development,We place an emphasis on communicating and engaging with our employees while encouraging them to share their thoughts with us.
Human Capital Development,"To this end, we have established multiple communication and feedback channels so that employees have a true stake in our business development."
Human Capital Development,"Our Annual Employee Meeting held at the end of the year is the most important and anticipated event, where the senior executive management will speak about the Company's strategy and commend outperforming teams."
Human Capital Development,"We have also created the Lewen Community, an internal Q&A forum, to promote open communication and mutual learning between departments and across hierarchies."
Human Capital Development,"To ensure that employees can submit appeals and receive timely feedback, we have, in addition to email, established an internal grievance platform."
Human Capital Development,"Employees can file various grievances, including those related to disciplinary violations by direct managers, probationary period assessments, performance assessments, and resignations."
Human Capital Development,We have established an independent investigation department to look into submitted cases and resolve and respond to appeals in a timely manner.
Human Capital Development,"As part of our efforts to gather employees' overall feedback and expectations of the Company, we have commissioned a reputable and independent third-party agency to conduct an online employee survey every year on their views on the work environment, values and culture, the Company's strategies and future direction among other topics."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, a total of 46,437 employees responded to the survey, the results of which revealed greater engagement and higher overall satisfaction rates year on year."
Human Capital Development,"Of all categories surveyed, the top three aspects employees were most satisfied with were ""Culture/Values"", ""Tech for Good"", and ""Company's Future Development""."
Human Capital Development,"For three consecutive years, ""Culture/Values"" received the highest recognition from our employees, scoring over 85% satisfaction rate."
Human Capital Development,We respect the career choices of our employees and have been transparent in setting out the terms of employment and applicable reasons for termination in labour contracts signed by employees.
Human Capital Development,Off-boarding is carried out in strict accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
Human Capital Development,We also conduct exit interviews with departing employees to understand their reasons for leaving so as to determine if and how we can do better as an employer.
Human Capital Development,"Every year, we analyse the turnover rate and formulate target and improvement measures."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, the overall employee turnover rate was 12.4%, which has remained relatively stable from previous years."
Human Capital Development,"To continue to advance Dow's ambition, we must develop tomorrow's talented workforce today."
Human Capital Development,"A focus of our 2025 ID&E strategy is improving representation across multiple dimensions of diversity, especially in areas where we have measurable gaps such as women globally and U.S. ethnic minorities."
Human Capital Development,External data and our own data prove that equity and inclusion in our hiring process led to more diverse outcomes.
Human Capital Development,We also introduced a structured interview process to ensure a consistent candidate experience and to mitigate bias.
Human Capital Development,"In 2020, we implemented a new inclusive hiring standard as outlined below."
Human Capital Development,"By institutionalizing inclusive hiring standards, Dow realized an increase in diverse hiring outcomes."
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, 31% of U.S. external hires were U.S. ethnic minorities and 35% were women globally."
Human Capital Development,Overall hiring increased 15% from 2020 to 2021.
Human Capital Development,"To reflect our continued commitment to diversifying our talent pipeline, Team Dow again hosted two signature internal recruiting events."
Human Capital Development,Diamond Symposium is intended for top U.S. ethnic minority undergraduate students from universities across the United States.
Human Capital Development,"In 2021, Dow hosted 53 students and extended 25 internship and full-time offers with 15 acceptances - increasing the offer acceptance rate from 2020 by 36%."
Human Capital Development,"BEST Symposium is primarily intended to introduce Black, Hispanic and Native American U.S. doctoral and postdoctoral scientists to the wide range of rewarding careers in industrial research and the many opportunities at Dow."

Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Employee Green Teams and the Trane Energy Services Team help us innovate and implement site-specific energy efficiency improvements at each Trane Technologies location.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"After achieving our goal to reduce energy intensity by 35% for U.S. operations by 2019 under the DOE Better Plants Program, Trane Technologies established a new Better Plants commitment in 2021 to reduce energy intensity by 20% in the next 10 years. We are also committed to doubling our energy productivity by 2035 from a 2013 baseline through the EP100 coalition and achieving an annual energy efficiency improvement of 3% through the Three Percent Club."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,We are on track to achieve these goals.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Sourcing renewable energy to power our operations is a significant part of our energy management strategy.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"We source renewable-based electricity from our own on-site photovoltaic/solar generation systems, through contracts with power suppliers who provide electricity directly from renewable systems (solar, wind, or water), and contracting for long-term power purchase agreements."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"At Trane Technologies, we continuously reduce our overall energy consumption to increase business productivity and reduce GHG emissions."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Within our operations, we use the same whole-system approach to energy efficiency as we offer our customers."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"We install passive heating and cooling techniques to reduce the needed load from HVAC systems, automate mechanical systems to reduce energy waste, and design smarter systems that support renewable energy integration and shift electricity demand during peak periods to reduce consumption of carbonintense electricity from the grid."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"By the end of 2021, we also modernized our fleet to 7% hybrid and full electric vehicles."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"As part of our membership in RE100, we set a goal to source 100% renewable electricity globally by 2040."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"We are on track to achieve our goal, and this year, 20 Trane Technologies locations (see mapping below) operated with 100% of their electricity provided directly or indirectly from renewable sources."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,These locations are RE100 compliant operations sites and make up over 50% of Trane Technologies' global electricity use.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Large-scale investments in renewable energy production are vital to shifting to a clean-energy economy.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"We invested in on-site solar energy generation at three of our facilities — Trenton, NJ, Columbia, SC, and Taicang, China — to reap the benefits of operational and cost consistency, which is especially important in parts of the world with uncertain electricity prices and availability, and to maintain close claims on credits."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"We partnered with local power companies to purchase the on-site photovoltaic (PV) systems located at our facilities in Trenton, NJ, and Columbia, SC."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The power companies own the renewable energy attributes generated by the PV systems, and Trane Technologies purchases Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in the matching amount of the renewable electricity generated."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The energy generated at our Taicang, China, manufacturing facility is used to power our operations directly and excess is sold to the grid during off-peak times."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In the last few months of 2021, we completed installation of a PV system at our Zhongshan, China, facility, which will begin generating solar electricity in 2022."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,These solar installations address about 14% of the electricity load across these three manufacturing sites.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"By generating renewable electricity, contracting with power companies who only supply renewable electricity, and the delivery of RECs through our VPPA, we achieved a reduction of 54% in our market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions since 2019."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In 2021, we began exploring a group PPA in Pakistan in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC)."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The PPA would reach multiple factories where opportunity exists to source onsite or offsite local solar energy at a better rate than the existing energy market.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,This work and projects like it will have a positive impact on our Scope 3 footprint.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"With excellent views of the Tanzawa Mountains and Mount Takao, this new town offers the best of both worlds - the beauty of nature and the convenience of urban infrastructure."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The design of this new town is based on the concept of combining homes with commercial facilities, giving residents the basic conveniences of daily life right on their doorsteps."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The commercial facilities are located next to a Disaster-Prevention Piazza which is equipped with light fittings powered by storage batteries that draw their electricity from solar panels, ensuring that this space remains lit even during a power blackout."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,This will help reassure residents of the community in the event of a major earthquake.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The town is attracting attention as a low-carbon community that features cutting-edge environmental protection technologies.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Each of the 127 single-family houses in the development is fitted with solar power generation systems (generating a minimum of 3kW) and a lithium-ion storage battery, as well as an electric vehicle recharging plug."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"All houses also feature home energy management systems (HEMS), that enable the home owners to monitor their own energy usage in an easy-to-visualize manner, allowing them to more efficiently employ the electricity produced directly from the home's solar power generation system or indirectly via the storage battery system."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Additionally, the design facilitates the efficient ventilation of home interiors through the use of natural wind-flow, creating a pleasant indoor environment."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"On top of that, we have created a system that allows the ranking of all the homes according to the extent of their contribution to the community's overall energy conservation effort, with prizes given to the home owners who register high scores."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,This is just one of the fun ideas we have put in place to minimize the environmental impact of the community as a whole.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,All homes are fitted with lithium-ion storage batteries.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Homes feature double-floor height spaces to facilitate ventilation using natural airflow.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Our environment-friendly design efforts are not limited to the homes themselves.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The commercial facilities area, which is directly linked with the residential area, also features intensive use of equipment for renewable energy generation and energy conservation."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"These include a 100kW solar power generation system and high-efficiency air-conditioning systems, which promise to deliver a reduction of 54 tons of carbon-equivalent per annum."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"All the buildings employ LED light fittings, in addition to ""light ducts"" that transmit sunlight efficiently to the buildings' interiors, thereby reducing power costs for lighting during the daytime."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,SMAxECO City Sagamihara Hikarigaoka Eco-Town is a futuristic community in which each home is fitted with solar power generation systems and lithium-ion storage batteries - the fruit of today's most advanced technologies.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"But the Company's town-planning concept covers far more than simply equipping the homes with newly developed equipment - we have also analyzed the local weather patterns and have used that data in the design of entire blocks to take maximum advantage of the differing prevailing winds in each season of the year, and in the design of individual homes to enable optimum utilization of natural ventilation."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Moreover, in planning the greenery that plays a major part in this housing development, we have made good use of the knowledge accumulated by our ancestors since ancient times regarding the planting and cultivation of trees, bushes, and other plants that are native to the area."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"On the human relations side of the equation, the community's Management Association organizes a variety of events throughout the year to enhance residents' enjoyment of their new homes."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,This relatively new development is already maturing into a community whose residents feel a sense of belonging.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Our goal has been to create a community to which children who have grown up here will be happy to return twenty years hence."""
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,On the panel is displayed the energy consumption figures for the whole community.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Not only can the community residents view this data, so also can residents of other nearby houses and apartment buildings who use the facility for shopping."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"This helps to spread the idea of efficient energy usage among the general population, and is one example of the sort of community-wide initiatives we have set in motion."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Located between the commercial facility and the residential area is the Disaster-Prevention Piazza, which can function as a gathering place for residents in the event of a major natural disaster."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The piazza includes benches that can be easily converted into outdoor cooking equipment to serve as substitutes for kitchen stoves, as well as seats that can be converted into emergency-use toilets."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"As this development was designed to integrate single-family houses and a commercial facility into a functional whole, we were able to locate the Disaster-Prevention Piazza (which can serve as a gathering place for residents of the entire area in the event of a major natural disaster) at a focal point where pedestrian flow naturally congregates."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"As a result, the facility has become well-known among people living within walking distance as a place that will welcome them, in addition to being known for its environmentally friendly design."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Consequently, the facility is used for shopping by many local people, most of whom arrive on foot or by bicycle rather than by car, and the facility and its environs are thus usually bustling with activity."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Additionally, a 100kW solar power generation system has been installed on the roof of this commercial facility."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The facility plays a valuable role in the local community thanks to the energy-usage monitor installed in a prominent position just outside the building - which displays energy data via easy-to-understand animations - and the outside staircase included in the facility to allow visitors (such as elementary schoolchildren on special after-school trips) to view the rooftop solar panels.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The community's Management Association - consisting of the owners of all the houses in the SMAxECO City Sagamihara Hikarigaoka Eco-Town development - takes the lead in providing opportunities - such as gardening lessons and lectures on energy conservation - for residents to meet one another and form relationships.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"On the eastern side of the community, where it abuts onto previously existing housing neighborhoods, we have provided the Community Center, which anyone in the local district is free to use, and this is linked with the commercial facility on the western side by a pedestrian path that leads right through the housing area."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,This design ensures that communication and interrelationships with other residents of the local district will take place naturally.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The Hikarigaoka Community Center, located within the town, is used as a meeting place for residents' associations and other community activities, and as a base for providing assistance to elderly residents."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Precisely because the broad streets that run north-south through the residential area describe gentle curves, one is even more aware of how green and pleasing to the eye the surroundings are."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The residents of this community adopted Sagamihara City's first agreement on neighborhood environmental aesthetics and to complement this Daiwa House has drawn up the Town Planning Guidelines, which include rules on the preservation of pre-existing trees, on the tending of gardens within the privately-owned home lots, and on the placement and brightness of nighttime illumination employed in the gardens."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The Company has also taken a variety of other steps to maintain and preserve a visually pleasing and safe living environment, including the placement and operation of security cameras at the entrances to the development."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The first residents to move into Hikarigaoka Eco-Town have now been living there for exactly one year.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Children's voices can be heard here and there throughout the development, and residents can be seen exchanging greetings as a matter of course."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,These are the signs that a real sense of community has begun to grow in Hikarigaoka Eco-Town.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"From now on, the focus of efforts must be on developing a pattern of collaboration with the pre-existing local community of which this development is a part."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"As a first step toward this goal we have taken steps to encourage residents to engage in friendly communications with one another, and to encourage individual residents to join hands with the governing board of the Management Association in spreading and deepening understanding of what this new community is all about."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"It is my hope that, from here on, too, we will be able to collaborate with other member companies of the Daiwa House Group, so as to serve effectively as partners in ensuring that the residents enjoy safe and comfortable lives with true peace of mind."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Thanks to the various efforts described above, SMAxECO City Sagamihara Hikarigaoka Eco-Town has been certified by the government of Kanagawa Prefecture as an ""Environmentally Symbiotic Town Planning Project."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In addition, in fiscal 2014 the project won a number of prizes, including the Judging Committee Chairman's Award, at the Land Utilization Model Project Awards (principally hosted by the Institute for Future Urban Development, a general incorporated association)."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,These awards were in recognition of the development's excellence as a sustainable community and its viability as a successful land-utilization model that comprehensively and effectively helps invigorate the economic and cultural life of its local region.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The awards were instituted to encourage the realization of vibrant local communities under the leadership of regional local bodies.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,There is a limit to how much contribution a single house can make to energy saving.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,We enhance the effective use of energy and accompanying reduction of CO2 emissions by the collaborative efforts of the entire town block.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Thus, power interchange involving all houses in a block has not yet been widely adopted."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In SECUREA Toyota Kakimoto, the entire power interchange block, consisting of the retention basin equipped with a solar power generation system, the lot for the SMA-ECO station where the community assembly hall is located, and the lot for three houses, is regarded as one unit of demand for electricity."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Equipment and devices within the block are connected in such a way as to facilitate power interchange.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"More specifically, with regard to the output from the solar power system and the output from the storage batteries in the power interchange block, Daiwa Energy Co., Ltd., a Daiwa House Group company, purchases the surplus from the community assembly hall and the entire output from the houses, and supplies the purchased electricity to places where there is a demand for electricity within the power interchange block."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"When electricity falls short within the block, electricity is supplied by an electric power company, and when electricity generation is in excess of demand within the block, the electricity generated from the solar system alone is transmitted to the electric power company."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Electricity is generated and consumed within the block to achieve ""local production for local consumption"" to reduce the consumption of the electricity supplied by an electric power company as much as possible."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The unified management by Daiwa Energy of the electricity generated and stored by the solar power generation system and the lithium ion batteries installed in the power interchange block enables us to improve the efficiency of the devices and ensure the stable supply of electricity.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The power interchange operation within the town block explained above is a new form of supply and demand of electricity for single-family houses.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,We will improve the system by reducing initial and maintenance costs as much as possible so that it can be used more widely.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Storage batteries are designed to operate only when a certain level of electric power load is applied to prolong the life of the batteries.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"For this reason, the power consumption of three houses is combined to increase opportunities for the batteries to discharge electricity and to improve battery operation rates and the conversion efficiency at the time of discharge."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Under the current fixed price purchase system for renewable energy, the period covered by the fixed price program is ten years for an individual house installed with a solar power system of less than 10 kW."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Under our project, the entire power interchange block is designated as one power generation unit and, therefore, a lower unit price for purchase is applied but the period covered by the program is 20 years."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In addition, in this town block, unlike others, the entire amount of discharged electricity from the solar power system and storage batteries can be sold to Daiwa Energy Co., Ltd."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"One of the success factors in this project is the well-balanced control of multiple storage batteries installed in different houses, which was achieved quickly thanks to the power interchange system developed through the cooperation among our Group companies."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The actual data obtained in this project on electric power supply and demand and the effects of power interchange will be used effectively, and more efforts will be implemented to be prepared for further expansion of the scale in the future."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In addition, to turn this project into an energy business, we will pursue an optimal energy supply and demand system for a town as a unit, taking into account the diversity of transaction forms, such as ""negawatt transactions."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"As John Deere continues to progress on achieving its 2022 Sustainability Goals, there are several bright spots aiding its success."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"One such example resides in India. John Deere's global Sustainable Energy Use goal is getting impressive engagement, and results, from the team at the company's manufacturing facility in Pune, India."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The Pune team's engagement began with a large offsite wind-supply agreement more than 10 years ago. Today, our Pune facility is also home to one of the enterprise's largest onsite solar installations."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"This has positioned Pune as an early leader in the company's renewable-electricity efforts in a strategy balancing onsite and offsite power solutions with long-term solutions. The Pune site is well on the way to having more than half of its electricity come from renewable sources by the end of 2022, which is the GHG emissions equivalent of removing over 2,000 passenger vehicles from the road per year."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Our India team is executing on a strategy to continue to grow the long-term renewable-energy supply for all our key India locations.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Renewable energy use is also part of our commitment to responsible environmental remediation, and in 2020 we used nearly 2.2 million kilowatt hours of power for remediation entirely from renewable sources."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,These projects included:
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"A retro-commissioning project in Schaumburg, Illinois, implementing building controls-based measures that produced savings by optimizing building operations."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"This project created electricity and gas savings of 941,051 kWh and 13,865 therms per year."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The project participated in ComEd's RCxpress utility rebate program and won the Project of the Year award from the program for most kWh saved by a single project.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Upgrading the electric terminal reheat system in Schaumburg, Illinois with a new hydronic perimeter HVAC system."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The new system is now able to be controlled by the centralized building automation system to further reduce consumption.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,We work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our data storage needs.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,AWS has set a goal of being 100% renewable by 2025 and we work with them on measuring and reporting the emissions associated with the services they provide us.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,AWS purchases and provides renewable electricity to us and provides attestations regarding their energy attributes.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"We also invest in the efficient distribution of our content through our Open Connect appliances, which we make freely available to Internet Service Providers."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Not included in our Scope 3 boundary are emissions from the internet transmission or electronic devices our members use to watch Netflix, like an Apple tablet, Android phone, or Samsung television."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,GHG accounting guidance does not yet exist for streaming companies on this topic.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Current best practice is for the Internet Service Providers and device manufacturers to account for those emissions within their target boundaries, because they have operational control over the design and manufacturing of their equipment12."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Led by researchers at the University of Bristol, DIMPACT created a tool to calculate the carbon footprint of streaming and other everyday internet uses, such as browsing news stories."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Through DIMPACT, we worked with peers and academic and industry experts to commission a white paper with well-regarded think tank Carbon Trust to correct inaccurate information about streaming emissions."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Results of this study indicate that one hour of streaming in Europe emits ~55gCO2 per hour.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"To be conservative, Netflix uses its own estimate of ""well below 100gCO2e per hour"" as a ceiling value13 that encompasses TVs and other viewing devices, home routers, internet infrastructure, and data centers14."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In comparison, ""the emissions from microwaving a bag of popcorn for four minutes is about 16gCO2e (also using a European average grid emission factor), while driving 100 meters in an average petrol car emits around 22gCO2e."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The tool's validation by Carbon Trust brings us closer to accurately assessing streaming's impact on climate - whether it's from the data centers, Internet Providers, or device manufacturers, and entertainment and media companies who rely on streaming."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Better understanding this footprint means we can better reduce emissions across industries, countries and the world."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"We're encouraged by Apple, Microsoft, Sony and others' commitments to tackle their devices' emissions during use, and are encouraging others to follow their example."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Recent efforts made by Amazon to quantify and reduce device emissions through efficiency measures and lifecycle assessments are particularly inspiring.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"And DIMPACT has expanded to include a device manufacturers working group, a response to the Carbon Trust white paper's finding that viewing devices are responsible for more than 50% of the overall carbon footprint of streaming for the average consumer."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Last March, we committed to reducing our emissions in line with the latest climate science, ensuring our internal reductions align with a trajectory of no more than 1.5°C of warming."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Our main sources of internal emissions from our productions, corporate offices, travel, and streaming can be boiled down to two basic categories: fuel we burn and electricity we consume."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"This includes electricity generated by fossil fuels, as well as the direct combustion of fossil fuels to heat buildings, on-set power generators, and for transportation."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"To achieve our internal reductions, we're focused on solutions most relevant to the entertainment industry ""Optimize, Electrify, Decarbonize"" strategy."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"With the rising cost of tuition, books and housing, Saskatchewan youth are presented with a financial burden that can potentially hinder their access to post-secondary education."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Fortunately, each year SaskTel awards numerous undergraduate and entrance scholarships to Saskatchewan post-secondary students who are studying in a field related specifically to information and communications technology."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In 2020/21, SaskTel awarded eight Scholarships to students attending post-secondary institutions in Saskatchewan who are studying in a field directly related to information and communications technology."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The Gord Kuhn Scholarship was established in the honour of long time SaskTel Employee Gord Kuhn and his 29 years spent with the company.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"At the time of his passing, Gord was serving as President of the Communications, Energy & Paperworkers Union Local S-1."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,This scholarship acknowledges Gord's valued commitment to SaskTel and his leadership in building a strong employer/union partnership.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The SaskTel Gord Kuhn Scholarship is $3,000 and is awarded to a current SaskTel employee (or immediate family member of a SaskTel employee) attending a post-secondary institution in Saskatchewan studying in a field directly related to telecommunications."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,The scholarships are contingent upon recipients proceeding to or participating in a full-time two-year diploma program related to telecommunications.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Our sustainability themes analysis has identified five impact areas of critical importance to our stakeholders that we need to take into consideration when building green energy assets.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Through our strategic priorities, we seek to advance our approach to each of these."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"If managed right, we can deliver tangible sustainability benefits from the green energy transition far beyond generating zero-emissions energy."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"From a life cycle perspective, wind energy emits 99 % less greenhouse gas emissions than coal power."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Yet, there are still emissions tied to the manufacturing and transportation of components for green energy assets, meaning that scaling green energy will increase the total supply chain emissions from renewables."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"In order to maximise the climate benefits of green energy and ensure that the energy industry delivers the carbon reductions needed to align with the 1.5 °C pathway, everyone in the industry has to play their part to reduce their emissions across scope 1-3."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,Learn how we are working to reduce our supply chain emissions on pp. 22-27 and 43.
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"The acceleration of the green energy build-out risks adversely impacting people throughout supply chains, specifically those in regions and industries where regulations are weak and the implementation of local legislation is defective."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Migrant workers are a particularly vulnerable stakeholder group in relation to hiring practices and general working conditions - with risks including poor living conditions, insufficient wage levels, excessive working hours, poor health and safety practices, and recruitment practices that create forced labour situations."
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Learn how we manage potential impacts on human rights in our global supply chains on pp. 34-35, 50, and 53"
Opportunities in Renewable Energy,"Over the next decade, renewable energy structures will become a part of many local communities."

Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The conflict minerals survey, which had previously been conducted in the Information Technology business, was evolved into a Company-wide initiative by expanding its scope to include the Life Care business as well in fiscal 2020."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We will continue to engage in initiatives with the cooperation of suppliers, including initiatives to identify smelters so that the procurement source of minerals will be limited to smelters that are compliant with the Responsible Minerals Assurance Program (RMAP)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We aim to source responsibly while acting as a catalyst of positive transformation for the well-being of people working in consumer product supply chains, working with others to realize the economic promise of supply chains and to help address specific systemic risks."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Retail supply chains bring food and other essential products to consumers around the world.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Growing, making and transporting products also benefits local economies and provides economic opportunity for billions of people who work in product supply chains, including lifting many out of poverty."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In some cases, however, people working in product supply chains may face the risk of exploitation, especially in regions with less robust legal and social infrastructure."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart's business depends on our ability to source responsibly made products; our core values of respect for the individual and for human rights demand it. Walmart's supply chain consists of more than 100,000 suppliers globally, many of whom have their own suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Our stakeholders expect us to not only source responsibly but to be a catalyst for positive transformation for the well-being of people working in supply chains: working with others to create economic opportunity and to address specific systemic risks at scale.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To promote the well-being of people in the supply chains in which we source, Walmart aims to source our products responsibly, create economic opportunity for people and collaborate with others to address systemic risks to worker well-being."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Responsible sourcing: Our approach begins with holding our suppliers accountable for the responsible operation of their facilities and for safeguarding the well-being of workers in their facilities and supply chains.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart expects that the products it purchases and sells are made in the right way by suppliers who act ethically, pay people fairly, provide working environments that are clean and safe, and respect the dignity of workers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We articulate this in our Standards for Suppliers, which apply to all suppliers who sell their products to us for resale or for Walmart's own use."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We employ a risk-based approach to monitor for compliance with our Standards and focus on areas that pose the greatest potential risk to worker dignity.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We also empower our merchants to make purchasing decisions that best promote our objectives and give our suppliers resources and information to help them understand and meet our expectations.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Creating economic opportunity for people in supply chains: Growing, making and transporting products benefits local economies and provides economic opportunity for billions of people who work in product supply chains, including lifting many out of poverty."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart annually sources billions of dollars of products from diverse suppliers and uses business and philanthropic resources to help smaller producers access markets and grow.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Collaborating to address systemic risks to worker well-being: Systemic issues such as forced labor, unsafe working conditions and gender inequity require collective action to bring about significant, positive and lasting transformation for the well-being of workers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart and the Walmart Foundation collaborate with suppliers, non-governmental organizations, experts and others to address root causes of these issues, foster innovative solutions and accelerate adoption at scale."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our Responsible Sourcing program sets expectations of product suppliers aligned with our Human Rights Statement, monitors supplier performance against those expectations and works through our business to continuously improve our product supply chains."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart's expectations of suppliers are set out in our Standards for Suppliers, which apply to all suppliers that sell their products to us for resale or for Walmart's own use."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Suppliers are expected to cascade the requirements outlined in our Standards for Suppliers throughout their supply chains - including raw material, component or ingredient suppliers, and subcontractors and agents."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These foundational expectations address fundamental issues such as worker safety, forced labor and discrimination in the workplace."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart merchandising and sourcing teams choose which products to buy and which suppliers to work with and are key to achieving Walmart's responsible sourcing objectives.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Their actions are guided by Walmart's Standards for Suppliers, Code of Conduct, Global Responsible Sourcing Compliance Policy, and Global Forced Labor Prevention Policy, among other resources."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart's Code of Conduct, which applies to all Walmart associates globally, reiterates our respect for human rights, prohibits the use of underage or forced labor anywhere we do business, sets the expectation that all Walmart associates know and uphold our Standards for Suppliers, and obligates associates to comply with all other relevant policies, including our Global Responsible Sourcing Policy and Global Forced Labor Prevention Policy."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart's Global Responsible Sourcing Compliance Policy establishes requirements for our merchandising and sourcing associates to buy and source from responsible supply chains, including by:"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Knowing and understanding our Standards for Suppliers and other relevant policies and program requirements
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Not knowingly buying or sourcing from suppliers that are producing products for Walmart using forced, underage, or involuntary prison labor; suppliers with facilities with known safety issues that may result in significant loss of life; or suppliers or facilities that are not authorized to produce for Walmart because of past compliance violations"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Communicating expectations and holding suppliers accountable to the Walmart Standards for Suppliers and Responsible Sourcing Compliance Program requirements
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Considering how certain buying practices might create pressures on suppliers and facilities that may increase risk
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Escalating concerns through our Ethics channels
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Additionally, Walmart's Global Forced Labor Prevention policy sets requirements for all Walmart associates regarding the prevention of forced labor and conveys the expectation that our suppliers uphold the principles in the policy."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The policy makes clear Walmart's endorsement of forced labor prevention principles, that workers should understand the terms and conditions of their employment, and that workers should have freedom of movement."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"It reiterates the expectation that merchandising and sourcing associates not knowingly buy or source from suppliers producing products using forced labor, including underage labor or involuntary prison labor, in their operations or their supply chain, and communicate expectations and hold suppliers accountable to the Walmart Standards for Suppliers and our Forced Labor Prevention requirements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Failure to comply with these policies may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To support our merchandising and sourcing teams and to build strong connections with local suppliers, Walmart has associates around the world dedicated to administering our Responsible Sourcing program."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As of January 31, 2021, Walmart Compliance associates located in 12 countries support the Responsible Sourcing program."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart's Responsible Sourcing Compliance associates provide ongoing support and guidance to merchandising and sourcing teams so they can align purchasing practices with program expectations.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"This includes helping these teams understand and mitigate risk and training them on responsible sourcing expectations, processes, trends and tools; working directly with suppliers to help create an understanding of our expectations; and collaborating with stakeholders on key industry and regional responsible sourcing issues."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart merchandising and sourcing associates are trained on our Global Responsible Sourcing Compliance Policy, our Standards for Suppliers and our responsible sourcing expectations on an ongoing basis."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition to training Walmart associates, we provide tools and resources to suppliers through various channels, including our corporate website to help them understand our expectations and to help them make improvements in their supply chains."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Additionally, after disclosing their production facilities to Walmart, suppliers receive email communications reiterating our Standards for Suppliers and providing references to resources to help them understand and meet Responsible Sourcing requirements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In FY2021, over 12,500 of these communications were sent to suppliers globally."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Finally, Walmart associates also provide individual guidance, including when suppliers or merchants reach out with questions and when audit results are shared with suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We take a risk-based approach to monitoring suppliers' facilities for compliance with our Standards for Suppliers.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,This approach includes audits conducted by third parties and handling of allegations through our case management process that can include investigations.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our monitoring program begins with our requirement that suppliers disclose to Walmart any facilities they are using to produce private and exclusive brand merchandise, goods imported by Walmart and items for our own use that carry the Walmart brand (such as shopping bags)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In some markets, and based on risk, we require additional facilities to be disclosed, and this requirement extends to goods not for resale."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Consistent with our Disclosure Policy & Guidance and Audit and Assessment Policy & Guidance documents, we rely on third-party auditing programs to monitor suppliers' social compliance at these facilities."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We do not wait for allegations of misconduct to audit.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Countries are assigned risk levels based on World Bank governance indicators.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Country risk level helps us decide what type of due diligence may be needed before we permit our suppliers to begin producing product for Walmart.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Facilities in lower-risk countries are typically subject to audits on a less frequent basis—but may be reaudited more frequently if prior results disclosed higher-risk findings—while facilities in countries that fall into medium and higher levels of risk are typically subject to regular audits, regardless of the outcome of earlier audits of the same facilities."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If a facility is in scope for an audit, a third-party audit is conducted to evaluate and monitor social compliance."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As of May 2021, Walmart recognized 11 approved third-party audit programs."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart assessed more than 14,000 third-party audit reports in FY2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart seeks to strengthen the capacity of the global social compliance audit system.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For example, we supported the establishment of the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (APSCA) to enhance the professionalism, consistency and credibility of the individuals and organizations performing social compliance audits."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart continues to support APSCA.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As of January 2021, more than 4,250 auditors had enrolled with APSCA. Walmart also works to improve individual audit programs."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To become approved by Responsible Sourcing, an audit program undergoes an extensive review that covers the program's audit content, methodology, program governance and quality assurance processes, among other components."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"After the review, we provide feedback to the programs on elements for improvement."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We may require elements to be addressed before the program can become an approved option for suppliers.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We continually engage with the programs to help mature them as necessary.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Suppliers are responsible for providing an audit report for facilities that fall within the audit scope and for correcting non-compliances identified.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have associates dedicated to support suppliers through this process, including communicating with suppliers about our requirements and checking the validity of submitted audit reports."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We also have associates dedicated to review each audit submitted and assign a rating to describe its compliance and risk level.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Central audit administration teams partner with the compliance teams in each country in which we operate to support merchants in understanding their suppliers' performance and any issues that warrant supplier engagement, as well as communicating with suppliers about audit results and expected next steps."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Facilities are assigned color ratings based on their compliance and risk levels.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,These ratings may come from audits or investigations.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Green: Highest level of compliance
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Yellow: Minimal issues to be addressed
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Orange: More significant issues that must be remediated
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Red: Serious issues that ordinarily lead to the facility no longer being authorized to produce products for Walmart
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Suppliers may also be given consequences for substantiated non-compliances.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Suppliers may be assigned a ""strike"" where they are directly responsible for non-compliant activities (i.e., action on their part as opposed to on the part of one of their facilities) and for certain serious violations by their facilities."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Ordinarily three ""strikes"" within a two-year period will lead to the termination of a relationship with Walmart."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart may also choose to sever its relationship with a supplier based on a single instance or event, as circumstances warrant."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart has several mechanisms for workers (and anyone with relevant information) to raise concerns directly to Walmart, and we require facilities producing for Walmart private brands to post signage in the local language that details how workers can use these mechanisms."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If we receive information alleging serious violations of our Standards by suppliers or their facilities, we manage those allegations through a case management process."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Our escalation criteria are informed by principles from the four International Labour Organization fundamental principles and rights at work.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In some cases, these efforts involve engaging with suppliers directly to discuss the allegations, clarify expectations and follow-up on remediation."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In more serious cases, we deploy a team of Walmart investigators to gather facts about the allegations through on-site visits to facilities or through other means."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For example, serious allegations that may warrant in-depth scrutiny could include indicators of forced labor, such as restriction of movement and excessive recruitment fees."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In FY2021, 843 cases were managed related to more serious allegations of non-compliances with our Standards for Suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"While the vast majority of audited suppliers' facilities are compliant with our foundational expectations (maintaining a Green or Yellow rating), audits and cases do surface more serious issues."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In our experience, staying engaged with a supplier through dialogue can have a more positive impact than abandoning a supplier relationship."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For example, in FY2021, nearly 30% of orange-rated facilities were remediated to either yellow or green assessments."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"However, certain non-compliance with our standards can result in consequences up to and including termination of a supplier's relationship with Walmart and our subsidiaries and/or a supplier's ability to use a particular facility for Walmart production."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Whether resulting from audits or cases, when higher-risk findings that could lead to a red rating (for a facility) or a strike (for a supplier) are identified, the compliance teams work with the relevant merchant teams to communicate the results, any business consequences and/or remediation expectations to the supplier."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In FY2021, 26 facilities received a red rating."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since 2012, Walmart has stopped doing business with 37 suppliers in response to serious violations of our Standards."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart sources billions of dollars from diverse suppliers and uses business and philanthropic resources to help smaller producers access markets and grow.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In India, Walmart has established the Vriddhi Supplier Development Program, which aims to train and prepare 50,000 of India's micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to ""Make in India"" for domestic and global supply chains by 2025."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through a collaboration with Swasti, the Walmart Vriddhi program aims to improve supplier capacity through training on business management, promotion of customer-centric strategies, workforce management and environmental sustainability."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In December 2020, Walmart announced that it will triple its exports of goods from India to $10 billion each year by 2027."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The new export commitment is expected to provide a significant boost to MSMEs in India.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Retail markets with leading small producer sourcing programs include Mexico, Central America, South Africa and India."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These businesses also have specialized supplier development programs focused on subject matter experts (SME), including examples such as Adopta Una PyME (""Adopt a SME""), Una Mana Para Crecer (""A Helping Hand""), Tierrra Fértil (""Fertile Soil""), and our South Africa Supplier Development Program that has procured more than $72 million of products from small and medium enterprises since 2012."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The Walmart Foundation has awarded grants of over $52 million to benefit smallholders in India, Mexico and Central America since 2017."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These grants are expected to reach over 293,000 smallholder farmers (44% of whom are women)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The grants provide access to training and capacity development along with market linkages for smallholders in Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As part of this total reach to smallholders, in India, the Walmart Foundation has an active $25 million five-year commitment to strengthen smallholders in FPOs."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Progress against this commitment to date includes 10 grantees with grant awards of just over $20 million, providing reach to over 170,000 smallholder farmers (57% of whom are women)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart uses its sourcing strategies to foster equity and inclusion of underrepresented and disadvantaged groups while enhancing our product offering.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart's supplier inclusion program provides companies owned and operated by racial and ethnic minorities, women, veterans, members of the LGBTQ+ community and people with disabilities equal access to work with us while at the same time growing their business."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,A diverse supply chain helps us deliver the products and services our customers want and need at affordable prices.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To help Walmart U.S. identify and support diverse suppliers, we have a Supplier Inclusion portal that provides information on our supplier diversity initiatives and requirements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also have a merchandising team dedicated to supplier diversity that works directly with interested suppliers and regularly attends business conferences, product and procurement fairs, expos and similar events to help identify potential new diverse suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart has a long history of supporting American-made products.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"According to data from our suppliers, in FY2021 nearly two-thirds of Walmart U.S.' total product spend was on items made, grown or assembled in the United States."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through our America at Work initiative, launched in 2013, we committed to invest an incremental $250 billion over 10 years in products that support the creation of American jobs."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As of the end of FY2021, we have achieved 93% of our expected progress through the first eight years of the initiative."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In March 2021, we announced an updated and extended commitment to invest an additional $350 billion in items made, grown or assembled in the United States over the next 10 years (through FY2031)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart estimates that this investment has the potential to support more than 750,000 new jobs."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Beyond foundational compliance, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation are working to address key issues in strategic supply chains by:"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Conducting due diligence, including funding research into the prevalence of social concerns in industry supply chains and/or regions and tracking progress toward improvement (e.g., the Walmart Foundation funded the first comprehensive study documenting the prevalence of forced labor and exploitation of fishermen on Thai fishing vessels in 2016, led by International Justice Mission)"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Engaging with governments to advocate for policy change and enforcement of current laws and regulations (e.g., we have advocated for responsible recruitment through the Bali Process and direct engagement with government leaders in southeast Asia)"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Collaborating with key stakeholders and thought leaders in task forces and consortia
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Supporting capacity in critical parts of the system
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Such efforts reflect our commitment to engage with stakeholders to address the major potential risks to the dignity of workers in a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We have focused on the following supply chains to date:
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Apparel in Bangladesh
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Produce in the U.S. and Mexico
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Shrimp in Thailand
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Tuna in Thailand
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Electronics sourced for the U.S. retail market
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Within these supply chains, we are focused on addressing issues of forced labor and responsible recruitment, worker safety and gender equity."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart has prioritized working with stakeholders to combat forced labor and other exploitative practices in global supply chains.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Debt bondage, one of the most common forms of forced labor, is often caused by employers and recruiters charging vulnerable workers exorbitant recruitment fees, which leaves workers indebted and unable to leave their jobs."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"While forced labor is a global problem, forced labor risks are most acute in certain geographies and supply chains, including products from Southeast Asia and agriculture in North America."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In FY2021, Walmart identified 23 audits which noted workers had paid recruitment fees to obtain employment and were escalated for further review."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2016, Walmart and Walmart Foundation set an aspiration to help make responsible recruitment the standard business practice for employers throughout global supply chains within a decade (by 2026)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since then, our business and philanthropic efforts have focused on the following:"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Strengthening demand for responsible labor and practices
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Using data and technology to increase transparency about labor practices
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Enhancing worker and community voice tools and mechanisms
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Supporting efforts to improve enforcement of existing regulations
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since FY2016, the Walmart Foundation has awarded over $40 million in grants to help strengthen worker dignity by promoting the responsible recruitment of workers and fair and responsible labor practices in global supply chains."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In the U.S., Walmart has incorporated training from Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT) that helps transportation professionals recognize and report suspected human trafficking incidents."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since 2019, TAT training has been a part of both the recurring driver training program and the new-driver onboarding process for our private fleet drivers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To date, we have used the TAT training to train over 16,500 drivers on how they can combat human trafficking while operating their vehicles."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart expects our suppliers to provide a safe working environment, but endemic safety challenges remain in many parts of the world."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We have prioritized initiatives focused on the apparel and footwear industries in geographies with acute safety challenges to help improve worker safety in our own supply chain and beyond.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart was a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which concluded its five-year mission at the end of 2018."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The Alliance trained nearly 1.6 million factory employees on basic safety and provided more than 1.5 million workers in 1,000 factories access to a helpline to anonymously report safety or other job-related concerns."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Approximately 93% of total remediation items across Alliance-affiliated factories were complete—including 90% of high-priority remediation items.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Although the Alliance's work concluded, we continue to prioritize safety in Bangladesh, including through Nirapon, an organization focused on monitoring ongoing safety compliance and maintaining the progress made through the Alliance and other safety initiatives."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart is a founding member (and on the steering committee) of LABS, an initiative comprising European and American brands that have come together to set international best practices for factory safety in the apparel and footwear industries."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,LABS is currently active in India and Vietnam.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,LABS works with engineering companies to develop country-specific standards for safety in factories.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"It also commissions audits around fire, electrical and structural risks and asks factories to develop supervised Corrective Action Plans to remediate problems and then assesses implementation of their plans."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"LABS also provides training for factory workers on safety, maintaining fire prevention systems, and use of the LABS helpline to report building safety concerns."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart was a member of the Joint Committee for Responsible Labor Practices , a committee convened by United Fresh and the Produce Marketing Association and including growers, packers, distributors, marketers and retailers of fresh produce and flowers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As a member of the Committee, Walmart helped to develop the Ethical Charter on Responsible Labor Practices."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The Charter contains guiding principles and values intended to provide a framework for responsible labor practices in fresh produce and floral supply chains.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The Charter is based on a foundation of employment law, good management systems and sound occupational safety and health practices."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since launching the Charter in 2018, Walmart has been an advocate of the Ethical Charter as it aligns with the values of our own Standards for Suppliers and a promoter of becoming an endorser."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The project started testing with selected suppliers and growers in 2020, and the learnings from the pilot will be shared with the industry associations mid-2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since 2011, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have shaped and participated in special initiatives to help empower women working in global supply chains around the world."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Most recently, these initiatives include overcoming barriers to market access for women smallholder farmers through the Walmart Foundation Market Access program, supporting the empowerment of women in factories through the Empower@Work Collaborative, and sourcing from women-owned businesses in the U.S. and other markets (with Walmart U.S. spending over $39 billion with women-owned businesses over the nine years ending in FY2021)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Such efforts build on the insights and momentum from our five-year Women's Economic Empowerment (WEE) initiative, which ran from 2012 to 2017 and included Walmart U.S. sourcing $20 billion from women-owned businesses as well as philanthropic support to train one million women on farms, in factories and in retail settings in emerging markets."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart Foundation's Market Access program, launched in 2017, focuses on helping Farmer Producer Organizations build capacity in India, Mexico and Central America to help smallholder farmers prosper."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The Walmart Foundation awarded grants of just over $52 million to benefit smallholders in India, Mexico and Central America between 2017 and the end of FY2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The Walmart Foundation's recently published white paper, Seeding advancement of women in smallholder farming: insights from the Market Access portfolio, highlights lessons learned from its Market Access portfolio."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We found that the following areas are most successful in accelerating female farmers' economic prosperity: women's membership and leadership in farmer producer organizations, women's skills and capacity development in farm production systems, women's inclusive crop and marketing programs and women's access to finance."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,COVID-19 created devastating impacts on global supply chains.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Low-wage, predominantly female garment workers have been disproportionately impacted, both by being put at risk and by spending savings on food and medical expenditures for their families."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In October 2020, to promote benefits to factory workers with a focus on women's well-being, Walmart entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with other retailers and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The MOU aims to establish a dialogue and identify any steps in the framework for further cooperation in activities that provide much-needed livelihood relief to the predominantly female workers in the supply chain.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We will continue to integrate efforts to support gender equity throughout our business, ranging from responsible sourcing standards and social auditing practices along the supply chain to internal gender equity policies, practices and commitments."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Human rights risks are complex and are often the result of systemic issues including deeply entrenched economic practices, workers lacking knowledge, support or tools to safeguard their rights, and inconsistent government regulation and enforcement across countries in which products are made."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Progress in addressing human rights issues is dependent on the maturity, rigor and efficacy of third-party standards and initiatives, which requires a critical mass of suppliers and retailers to align on common standards and best practices."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For certain practices, there currently is no universal set of standards for responsible or sustainable production and/or certification beyond compliance with the law (e.g., responsible recruitment, wage/hour)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Furthermore, there are limits to the efficacy of tools used to monitor compliance with expectations."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The success of Walmart's programs is dependent on suppliers' capacity and willingness to meet high standards, as well as their performance."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Human rights risks are often upstream and beyond the reach of traditional retailer oversight and monitoring tools.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Lack of reliable data on source/origin of certain commodities and product ingredients and the way they are produced—as well as the blending and commoditization of product inputs and ingredients—is a complicating factor.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The use of technology improving transparency and traceability (e.g., blockchain) can help, but adoption takes time and further innovation is necessary to meet these challenges."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The breadth of Walmart's global product offerings and dispersed geographical reach of supply chains can present challenges for supplier engagement and risk identification and mitigation.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Growth in and/or changes in our business can challenge our ability to meet customer demands consistent with our aspiration.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Pandemics, weather-related events and political/social unrest can create supply/demand volatility and interrupt supply chains."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart aims to accelerate progress on the sustainability of our own assortment as well as product supply chains across the retail and consumer goods industry, with a focus on environmental and social issues including climate, nature, waste, working conditions, responsible recruitment and economic opportunity for people working in product supply chains, and the availability of affordable, safer and healthier food and other products."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Retail supply chains bring quality, affordable products to consumers around the world."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Sustainable supply chains create value for companies and for society by mitigating business risks, increasing supply chain resilience and efficiency, improving product availability and quality, building trust and creating opportunities for workers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Walmart's supply chain reaches more than 100,000 suppliers globally and many of those suppliers also have their own supply chain."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart expects that the products we purchase and sell are made in the right way by suppliers who act ethically and respect the dignity of workers.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart's stakeholders—including its customers—have the same expectations
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, companies like Walmart need to be part of the solution to environmental challenges such as climate change and depletion of natural capital in order to maintain our license to operate, uphold supply and create value for business and society through regenerative initiatives that draw on our unique corporate capabilities."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As a multicategory retailer operating around the world and with a global supply chain, Walmart engages suppliers, customers and NGOs in sustainability initiatives across a wide range of product supply chains."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Because of the complexity of global supply chains and the systemic nature of issues such as climate change or forced labor, lasting improvement requires collaboration among many stakeholders."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To improve the sustainability of a given product supply chain, we start by listening to our customers and other stakeholders to set aspirations, such as emissions reduction or economic inclusion, and prioritize improvements to the product supply chain system, such as farming practices or commodity traceability."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We make progress by:
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Setting standards and requirements for Walmart product sourcing
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Engaging Walmart suppliers to spark action, share best practices and tools and encourage measurement and disclosure"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Leading and contributing to industry consortia and initiatives to accelerate collective action beyond Walmart
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Helping Walmart customers make informed choices through labeling and cause campaigns
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Advocating for public policies that align with sustainable supply chain priorities
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Accelerating systems change beyond Walmart through philanthropic investments
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Walmart uses sourcing requirements and specifications to signal demand for more sustainable products.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Requirements: Our Standards for Suppliers outlines our expectations for suppliers and supply chains, including on the dignity of workers in the supply chain, environmental protection, food and product safety, and ethics and integrity."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The Standards are supported by our Human Rights Statement and complemented by several supplier compliance policies, including our Global Forced Labor Prevention Policy, Global Responsible Sourcing Policy, and Global Food Safety Policy."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Read more about Walmart's approach to responsible sourcing, including our risk-based approach to monitoring and compliance with our standards: People in supply chains brief and our Walmart Policies and Guidelines page."

Supply Chain Labor Standards,Our Acer Group Standards of Business Conduct (SBC) reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,‧ As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) - a nonprofit coalition of electronics companies committed to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities engaged in the global electronics supply chain -- we demonstrate our commitment to environmental and social responsibility.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"RBA members commit publicly to the RBA code of conduct (the ""Code of Conduct"") and are expected to actively pursue conformance to the Code of Conduct and its standards as a total supply chain initiative."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"‧ We require all manufacturing suppliers to abide by all applicable laws and regulations and by the RBA Code of Conduct, by treating employees with respect and dignity."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We haves taken multiple actions to ensure social responsibility and labor rights in our supply chain.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer believes that all work shall be voluntary and workers shall be free to leave work at any time or terminate their employment.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer requires its suppliers to adhere to its Code of Conduct and verifies the conformance with routine audits.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Student workers and interns comprise a high-risk group in terms of human rights in the electronics supply chain.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Student workers may not exceed 20% of total direct employees.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Excessive working hours are one of the most common labor problems in the supply chain.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance, Acer requires suppliers to comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and the Acer Supply Chain Working Hours Policy."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through the policy, we communicate and cooperate with our suppliers to reduce excessive working hours in the supply chain and improve the health and morale of workers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Suppliers must ensure that its employees work in compliance with local laws.

Supply Chain Labor Standards,Suppliers shall ensure that any overtime worked is voluntary and compensated at a premium rate.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Wages should always be enough to meet basic needs for employees.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Conduct internal professional training for procurement staff to learn to identify and address root causes of excessive working hours such as the communication and understanding of production scheduling and implementing responsible planning and purchasing practices.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Enforce these policy expectations and conformance to the RBA Code of Conduct through 3rd party verified audits and participation in the RBA Validated Audit Process (VAP).
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2010 the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was passed and has been into effected on January 1, 2012."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California and have annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million U.S. dollars to be transparent about the efforts they have undergone to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As Acer is a member of the RBA, we require our suppliers to abide by the RBA code of conduct, especially with regards to their workforces."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The RBA code of conduct specifically forbids malpractices such as using forced labor, underpaid labor, involuntary prison labor, or binding workers to unreasonable contracts."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have adopted Supply Chain Labor Rights Management Process, to prevent the possibility of any of our suppliers engaging in forced labor or human trafficking."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For complete information concerning Acer' supply chain responsibility program and specific audit findings, please see Acer Corporate Responsibility Reports."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We therefore take a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking both in our business and in the businesses of our suppliers.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We are committed to acting ethically in all our business dealings and relationships wherever we operate and implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter slavery and human trafficking.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"It is our Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy to conduct all our business ethically and in accordance with the UK Government' Modern Slavery Strategy, as amended from time to time, and as outlined in the UK Home Office Guidance ""Transparency in Supply Chains: a Practical Guide"" published on 29 October 2015."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Child labor refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives the children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The term ""child"" refers to any person under the age of 15, or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If child labor is discovered in the supply chain, Acer will remedy the impacts of this atrocious condition by implementing the following measures."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If child labor is found at an Acer supplier factory, the factory must immediately remove the child from the workplace."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The factory where the child labor was found must send the child to have special labor health check to make sure his/her health is not affected by the work.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If affected, all the fees, including medical treatment cost and living cost, must be covered by the factory."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The factory where the child labor was found must contact the family and send the child home.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,All expenses related to transporting the child home must be covered by the factory.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The factory where the child labor is found shall continue to pay the wages until the child is of legal working age.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The factory shall provide Acer with the name and address of the school in which the child is enrolled.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The Corporate Sustainability Officer of Acer should notify the related head of the Acer BU and BG to discuss this core non-conformance situation.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer shall identify the risk of repeated child labor conditions through an unannounced audit of the affected factory within 6 months.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Forced labor refers to situations in which persons are coerced to work through the use of violence or intimidation.

Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer shall identify the risk of repeated forced labor conditions through an unannounced audit of the affected factory within 6 month.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Acer is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), an alliance of the world' leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The RBA Code of Conduct establishes standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Benefits of RBA Code of Conduct can already been seen in the reduction of supplier' work duplication; improvement of our supplier' ability to meet social and environmental standards; and an increase of communication opportunities with stakeholders.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Fundamental to adopting the Code is the understanding that a business, in all of its activities, must operate in full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of the countries in which it operates."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We encourage suppliers to go beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognized standards, The Code is made up of five sections:"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Our supplier should confirm its understanding of the content of RBA Code of Conduct; complete or update the Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ); submit an improvement action and/or progress report to meet RBA Code of Conduct.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"All our manufacturing suppliers have to sign a ""Declaration of Compliance with RBA Code of Conduct"", pledging not only their compliance with Acer requirements to disclose social and environmental information, but also to confirm their operations and their suppliers' operations adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct and local laws."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The purpose of this is to let suppliers clearly understand Acer' requirements regarding supplier conduct then obey it.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer holds the Supplier CSR Conference each year.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The conference is the time when we announce the global trend and targets that we expect our suppliers to meet, which is in line with international practice."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"At the conference we introduced the RBA Code of Conduct, Noncompliance of on-site audit, labor rights, environmental responsibility and carbon management, CSR scorecard and other main issues."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We will continue to communicate and cooperate with our suppliers in order to bring the collective strength of Acer' supply chain to bear on social and environmental issues.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We are taking a more proactive stance and looking at the big picture as we investigate sustainable development issues that require our response.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Acer has been a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) since 2008, and actively participates in actions and discussions around supply chain social and environmental responsibility to better understand international trends in CSR and share in the practical experience of its members."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"With Acer's adoption of the RBA Code of Conduct, all Acer manufacturers and service providers are required to comply with both the RBA Code and local regulations, regardless of any regional variation."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also carry out annual on-site RBA Code of Conduct supplier audits, gaining a deeper understanding of each location's working environment and the human rights conditions of the staff."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We encourage and require vendors to uphold their corporate responsibility by ensuring they implement socially and environmentally responsible management and advocate for RBA Code of Conduct adherence, thus improving the working environment in the electronics supply chain worldwide."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have also established the Acer Responsible Supply-Chain Management (ARSM) system, not only setting in place the social and environmental responsibilities of our first-tier suppliers, but also rolling it out to second- and third-tier suppliers in phases."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The goal of this is to further expand the reach of our social responsibility and influence.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer requires first-tier suppliers to implement risk assessment and management of second-tier suppliers based on the RBA Code of Conduct.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Additionally, in 2019, we incorporate performance in this regard into our vendor CSR scorecard assessments."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We anticipate the scope of supply chain responsibility management to have expanded to third-tier suppliers by 2021.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We carry out supplier CSR scorecard evaluations, reviewing the implementation of CSR among our suppliers and their performance."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Such assessments are part of proper CSR practice and performance, and in quarterly business review meetings, the results have been provided to senior management of Acer and our suppliers, driving our bilateral business relationships forward."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We continue to communicate with vendors and enhance their ability to respond to sustainability issues, as well as encouraging vendors to incorporate sustainable development matters into their management agendas."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In line with Acer's sustainable development strategy, we hold a variety of vendor sustainability conferences, and in our annual vendor CSR communication meetings, provide information on the latest in CSR developments and trends, as well as analyzing important supply chain matters and potential actions that we can take together."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These meetings also provide an opportunity for two-way communication between Acer and vendors, strengthening the supply chain's environmental and social responsibility and deepening our CSR-related cooperative relationships."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have adopted the RBA Code of Conduct and, with reference to the RBA Supplier Engagement Process, make use of a range of supplier social and environmental management approaches, engaging with vendors through multiple channels and working with them to improve their capabilities."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The implementation of such management approaches also entails assessment, validation, and ongoing improvement thereof, and through management measures at every stage, Acer and our suppliers are able to work together effectively to establish a sustainable supply chain with a focus on environmental and social issues."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,New vendors pass a social and environmental responsibility risk assessment and sign an RBA Code of Conduct compliance declaration before they become official vendors.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since 2014, these have been part of quarterly business review meetings focused on major product lines and key components since 2014 and provided to senior management of Acer and our suppliers, serving as a driving influence behind our bilateral business relationships."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Overall, the average performance of suppliers on the CSR scorecard in 2019 again improved compared to the previous year; nearly 48.6% of suppliers achieved an ""excellent"" standard, and nearly 51.4% of suppliers were at the ""medium"" level."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"This mechanism will continue in the future, and according to internal and external issues and past performance, we will make any necessary adjustments to weighting or items to be assessed."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Acer's suppliers must treat their staff in a respectful manner, using environmentally responsible manufacturing processes and providing safe working conditions."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have adopted the latest version of the RBA Code of Conduct, which covers the five major aspects of labor, health and safety, the environment, ethics, and management systems."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,This system is used in our on-site audits of suppliers with regard to both social and environmental responsibility.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through different auditing methods adopted based on the particular nature of the supplier's operations and their implementation of the RBA Code of Conduct, we can verify any lapses we may find in the aforementioned five areas and require suppliers to take corrective steps by a given deadline."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer uses risk assessment results as the basis for on-site audits and assessments.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We examine the country risk, manufacturing processes, and products of each supplier, along with the results of previous audits, as well as taking into account the concerns of stakeholders when setting out our annual audit plan."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2020, we conducted a total of 93 audits."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Among these audits, one had relocated to a new plant and six had newly launched plants for Acer products."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The approach covers third-party audits (CMA or AMA), RBA Validated Audit Process (VAP), BSCI, SA-8000, accreditation, etc."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We particularly encourage suppliers to undergo the Validated Audit Process (VAP) themselves, resulting in a broader scope of application of audit results that can help boost overall industry responsibility and compliance."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2020, more than 190,000 direct employees of suppliers were audited, 3,617 of whom were interviewed."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, to effectively improve implementation through the supply chain, Acer has required its first-tier suppliers to conduct pre-audit risk assessments of their next-tier suppliers of critical raw materials since 2017."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"After aggregation, high-risk suppliers accounted for 12% of the total, with the medium-risk suppliers at 23%."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We continued to carry out auditing activities in 2020 along these lines, auditing a total of 827 second-tier factories."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2020, we also further deepened our implementation across the supply chain, extending our auditing activities to third-tier suppliers, of whom we conducted 520 audits in the year."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, we plan to conduct on-site audits of 70 first-tier supplier manufacturing plants, covering 140,000 direct employees and interviewing 2,500 other employees."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Suppliers found to have concerns regarding child labor, falsification of records, discrimination issues, high levels of Priority Non-Conformance, or low audit scores will be listed as potential subjects of unannounced audits."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition to unannounced audits, Acer also consults inspection results and conducts on-site technical seminars for suppliers that are struggling, sharing with them industry trends and offering guidance on improvements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through continual monitoring of improvement progress over more than two years, the results have shone through."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The main lapses in terms of labor rights were some problems around working hours and pay.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The others are mainly related to hazardous substance control, emergency preparedness, and occupational safety, and gaps in potential hazard control implementation."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"During the pandemic, it has made labor recruitment and deployment even more complicated and challenging due to the scarcity and lack of mobility of labor in many regions."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Suppliers have generally used retention and newcomer referral bonuses to address short-term workforce shortages.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, some manufacturers have changed to a single-shift rostering method to boost flexibility of deployment to cope with the impact of urgent order demand."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Some manufacturers are actively developing and introducing automated equipment to replace some labor.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer also continues to implement bi-monthly attendance tracking and control for its OEMs to remotely monitor the effectiveness of the supplier attendance management mechanism.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Regarding the issue of labor remuneration, the main problem is the lack of current settlement of shortfall pay for departing employees."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"After much advocacy in recent years, this situation has been significantly improved."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"However, we found that a few companies had the same problems as those mentioned above."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Based on previous experience, we shared our approach and called for immediate improvement."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In terms of environmental safety and health deficiencies, emergency response facilities, and hazardous substance management are the main areas of deficiency."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As for the emergency response facilities, some manufacturers failed to consider fire escape routes when adjusting or changing the layout of factory equipment, resulting in a failure to update labeling or meet standards for emergency exits and the width of escape routes."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Since there is a high potential safety risk for this type of deficiency, these manufacturers are required to take immediate corrective measures to rectify the situation."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Regarding the management of hazardous substances, these lapses are mainly attributable to the fact that only the product name is marked on the vial container when it is re-packed and given to the production department, but the relevant composition information and emergency disposal instructions are not clearly marked."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Having been corrected, the manufacturer has completed the labeling of the containers (including labeling of hazardous chemicals, names, composition, emergency disposal methods, emergency contact information, and manufacturer) to protect the health and safety of workers on site."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Acer issues Corrective Action Reports (CAR) to audited suppliers in response to any issues of non-compliance identified.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Within 30 days of receiving such reports, suppliers must produce a written CAR of their own and submit it to Acer for approval by management."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,These reports will be followed up on each month and verified against the on-site audit the following year.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"With regard to high-risk suppliers, as found in the audits, Acer will make the necessary adjustments to our purchasing strategy to manage the issue."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2020, 126 deficiencies were identified in Acer's document reviews and staff audits, and as of December 31, 2020, all suppliers had responded with action plans for improvement."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, we have also set the following annual RBA Code of Conduct on-site audit conformance targets: labor: 87%, health and safety: 87%, environment: 95%, ethics: 95%, management systems: 95%."

Supply Chain Labor Standards,All new and potential suppliers are evaluated according to stringent procedures.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Suppliers are required to fill in the vendor registration form, which helps us assess various aspects including quality assurance, CSR and corporate governance."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"GPS then works with an independent third party to investigate the background of the company, mainly focusing on their financial credibility."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The department also conducts an assessment of the supplier's quality of delivery, environmental and social compliance and internal controls."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,GPS undertakes annual performance reviews of our existing major suppliers and contractors.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, each BU assists in regular assessments on the performance of suppliers upon the receipt of goods and services."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We have also introduced the Selective Supplier Review and Sustainable Quarterly Review to enhance our supplier management.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Any supplier with an unsatisfactory or low rating in the review is jointly assessed by the relevant BU and GPS.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"When necessary, we promptly communicate with the supplier in question on rectification or improvements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If unsatisfactory ratings are repeatedly found or the supplier severely violates our standards, we would consider terminating the contract or blacklisting the supplier."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"From time to time, we conduct visits and management meetings to ensure suppliers strictly comply with our policy requirements, and to assess their production capability and quality management system."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"This year, 115 supplier visits were conducted."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Being a founding member of the Sustainable Procurement Charter launched by the Green Council, PCCW is committed to promoting sustainable procurement practices to companies in Hong Kong."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"During the procurement process, social, ethical and environmental performance factors are incorporated into our consideration."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Sustainable procurement measures are also included in GPS's Risks and Opportunities Register.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Furthermore, we clearly state the clauses of ""Environmental Protection"", ""Notes for Sellers for CSR"" and ""Energy Efficiency"", among others, in our procurement contracts to ensure effective demonstration of our commitment."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, we are aware of our environmental and social impact throughout the supply chain."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We worked with over 4,150 suppliers during the reporting year, of which 80% are based in Hong Kong."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The procurement decision of prioritizing local suppliers helps minimize carbon emissions resulting from transportation.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,AIG recognizes that our suppliers play an important role in our success.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We are committed to making a positive difference in the communities where we work, live and serve our customers, and we expect the same of our suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Our suppliers are expected to follow the basic principles outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct and to apply these or similar principles to the suppliers with whom they work in providing goods and services to AIG.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct, AIG expects our suppliers to establish and implement sustainability goals that minimize environmental impact and to manage their social risks ethically and responsibly."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"AIG incorporates ongoing compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct into its business relationships and procurement decisions, and we have continued to evolve our supplier evaluation process to include a quantitative assessment of key environmental, social and human rights criteria and metrics."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our Supplier Code of Conduct makes clear to our suppliers that, to the extent reasonably practicable, they should take action to reduce waste, emissions and energy use associated with their operations."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Embedded in the Marketplace Pillar of our Global DEI corporate strategy, our Supplier Diversity program seeks to foster a more inclusive supply chain by partnering with leading diverse advocacy organizations and councils, participating in corporate responsibility efforts and engaging diverse suppliers in our procurement efforts."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We continue to focus on growing and developing this program, and we believe supporting diverse businesses makes a positive difference in the communities and markets where we do business."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Diverse-owned businesses are defined as U.S.-based, for-profit enterprises that are at least 51% owned and operated by one of the following groups:"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,AIG requires that all diverse-owned businesses provide certification of their diverse-ownership status through a third-party agency.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,AIG recognizes certifications from the following organizations/entities:
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through procurement policies, processes and tools informed by our Supplier Diversity program, we actively seek and create economic opportunities for underrepresented small and diverse-owned businesses."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,This provides us access to the widest possible selection of qualified suppliers and innovative solutions and is a driver of our cost reduction efforts.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As a result of this program, AIG awarded more than $60 million of business to certified diverse suppliers and organizations in 2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Syngenta operates in complex supply chain networks across the globe. Our key direct procurement activities are in the chemical, seed and flower supply chains:"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"From producers of basic commoditized chemistries to advanced custom manufacturers of fine chemistries, we work with more than 600 suppliers in more than 30 countries around the world to procure the chemicals required to manufacture our crop protection products."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also work with suppliers of packaging and other direct materials as well as with formulation, fill and pack tollers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We work with over 65,000 small, medium and large farms in about 35 countries to multiply the high-quality seeds we sell to our customers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our network of approximately 35 owned and third-party commercial flower farms in over 15 countries produce flower seeds, cuttings and young plants."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,These supply chains have their own diverse challenges.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In our seed supply chain, agriculture work is heavy and often involves long working hours in conditions that carry many risks, including exposure to hazardous chemicals, machinery and the climate."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In our chemical supply chain, despite advanced health and safety prevention practices in chemical production, improper handling of chemicals could still have adverse consequences for humans and the environment."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,These supply chains also represent the most significant portion of our carbon footprint.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,This is why working with our suppliers to identify and deliver improvements is critical to achieving our carbon reduction goal.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Syngenta expects suppliers to uphold the standards set out in our Syngenta Group Code of Conduct, Compliance guide for third parties and Minimum requirements for suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our supplier relationship management approach enables us to manage suppliers effectively, while focusing on our most critical suppliers to maximize value and reduce risks in our supply chain."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We engage in regular, open dialogue with suppliers to develop strong positive relationships in the marketplace."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To assess and improve the standards of our suppliers, we monitor their performance through audits and assessments."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,These are either conducted by our own teams or in collaboration with partners.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"When gaps are identified, we support suppliers in making the required improvements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To ensure our seed suppliers meet our fair labor standards, the Syngenta Fair Labor Program monitors labor practices on our farm network, including health and safety, child labor, wages and benefits, working hours, freedom of association and collective bargaining, harassment and abuse, forced labor and nondiscrimination."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We engage with our chemical suppliers through our Supplier Sustainability Program, which includes on-site audits by our own teams, and audits or online EcoVadis-supported assessments conducted through the chemical industry's Together for Sustainability(TfS) initiative, which follow the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, Responsible Care® and the International Labor Organization."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also engage with chemical suppliers to measure and improve their carbon, water and waste impacts."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Our flower business is working to obtain GlobalG.A.P. and GlobalG.A.P. Risk Assessment on Social Practice (G.R.A.S.P.) certification for our commercial flower farms.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"GlobalG.A.P. is the worldwide standard for good agricultural practices and G.R.A.S.P. assesses social practices on the farm, addressing specific aspects of workers' health, safety and welfare."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We report on the coverage of sustainability and fair labor programs in our key direct procurement activities through the following KPIs:
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also report the percentage of farms monitored, which represent the seed supply farms in the program that have undergone an internal monitoring process by Syngenta."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Percentage of chemical suppliers, formulation, fill and pack tollers and packaging manufacturers that are included in our Supplier Sustainability Program."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In this KPI, only chemical suppliers or formulation, fill and pack tollers categorized as posing a high or medium sustainability risk are included."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Percentage of Syngenta and third-party commercial flower farms that have a valid GlobalG.A.P. certificate, as well as percentage of Syngenta commercial flower farms that carried out a G.R.A.S.P. social practice assessment."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We know that we cannot reach 100% because of constant changes in our supply chains.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, 99.7% of our seed supply farms were part of the Syngenta Fair Labor Program."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Driven by market demand, the total number of seed supply farms increased by 48% to reach 66,667 farms in 2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Over 80% of the new supplier farms added in 2021 focus on reproducing corn seeds in India and Indonesia.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The seed supply chain represents 98.9% of all suppliers targeted by our sustainability and fair labor programs.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The Syngenta Fair Labor Program is in place in 91% of our seed producing countries (32 out of a total of 35): Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, UK, Ukraine, US and Vietnam."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,South Korea and Zambia were removed from the list because Syngenta stopped production in these countries.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The percentage of farms undergoing internal monitoring slightly increased to 23%, which is in line with the total increase of seed farms in the Asia-Pacific region."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To support this growing focus, we have sought a partnership with an organization that we can engage with in all aspects of sustainability."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"This led Syngenta to end its affiliation with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) in 2021, and extend its existing partnership with Solidaridad to include Seeds sustainability activities."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We worked with the FLA between 2004 and 2021 to address labor standards in our seed supply chain and to develop our Syngenta Fair Labor Program.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"They have been excellent partners on this journey, and we are grateful for their support and insight."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We are now working with Solidaridad to build capacity in areas where we are ramping up our activities and where their technical expertise and relationships will strengthen our existing sustainability programs.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, the percentage of chemical suppliers included in the program remained stable at 95% while the percentage of formulation, fill and pack tollers decreased to 74% (-12 percentage points)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Although COVID19 restrictions significantly reduced the number of audits that we were able to execute at these tollers, we maintained focus via online follow-ups to address gaps in corrective action plans and via TfS Sustainability assessments on the EcoVadis platform."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Thanks to business growth across all regions, the total number of packaging suppliers we are working with grew in 2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, 97% of all farms had the GlobalG.A.P. certification, a six-percentage point increase compared to 2020 thanks to five additional suppliers being newly certified (35 in 2021 vs. 30 in 2020)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,85% of Syngenta commercial flower farms carried out G.R.A.S.P. social practice assessments this year. This decrease in coverage is due to two of our sites in Kenya no longer being considered as G.R.A.S.P.-certified as GlobalG.A.P. stopped recognizing the Kenya Flower Council Silver certificate as equivalent to G.R.A.S.P. in 2020. Both sites will therefore request to be assessed directly by the GlobalG.A.P. certification body.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Three new farms located in Kenya have successfully achieved the GlobalG.A.P. certification in 2021, despite the challenges of COVID-19."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, they became the first third-party seed suppliers to complete the added G.R.A.S.P. social assessment alongside our home farms."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To drive responsible and sustainable practices, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our manufacturing operations."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We collaborate with other companies and lead initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing industry collaboration on responsible minerals sourcing."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, and conduct training."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"More than 9,000 tier 11 suppliers in 87 countries provide direct materials for our production processes, intellectual property, tools and machines for our factories, logistics and packaging services, software, office materials, and travel services for Intel."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also rely on others to manufacture, assemble, and test some of our components and products."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"See a list of our Top 100 Production and Service Suppliers, in the Appendix."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We continue to collaborate extensively with supply chain-related organizations—including the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and its Responsible Minerals Initiative and Responsible Labor Initiative, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and SEMI—to help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, conduct training, address third-party anti-corruption issues, and more."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We expect our suppliers and their suppliers to comply with the Intel Code of Conduct, Intel's Supplier policies, and the RBA Code of Conduct (RBA Code)."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The RBA Code describes industry environmental, social, and ethical standards, and is consistent with the Intel Global Human Rights Principles, the Intel Statement on Combating Modern Slavery, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For more, read our RBA Commitment Letter."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also expect and enable our suppliers to develop their own corporate responsibility strategies, policies, and processes; set goals and report on their performance; engage with and audit their own suppliers; and develop, manage, and regularly test their business continuity plans."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, we continued to review ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges through our Supply Chain Command Center."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our supplier development, monitoring, and enforcement efforts are integrated across our commodity teams."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"This integration allows us to scale our coverage, support supplier progress, and influence suppliers that may be reluctant to meet our requirements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We communicate our expectations in our supplier contracts and requestfor-proposal documents, on our supplier website, at meetings and training events, and in annual letters to suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We hold ourselves accountable to meet or exceed the same standards that we set for our suppliers, and audit ourselves to the same protocols."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We follow the RBA Validated Assessment Program (VAP) to conduct audits of our finished goods factories.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, we conducted an RBA VAP audit of our facilities in Kulim, Malaysia and addressed all findings."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2022, we plan to have RBA audits of our facilities in Vietnam and Costa Rica."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For more than a decade, we have worked to help less mature and evolving suppliers build critical sustainability and corporate responsibility acumen, including a focus on compliance with the RBA and our Code of Conduct expectations and requirements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have delivered a broad range of no-cost support options for suppliers, including online resources, interactive training sessions, and connection to external resources such as the RBA and other NGO training and conferences."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Safety Programs.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We set high safety training and performance expectations during our contracting process and orientation for new suppliers.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We validate that suppliers have robust safety management systems and employee safety training programs in place, and evaluate supplier safety performance for compliance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards, OSHA regulations, and Intel's minimum safety requirements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, we partnered with more than 50 suppliers to elevate their safety management systems to ensure safe work practices at Intel sites."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, we worked with 43 suppliers to close 131 occupational health and safety audit findings and improve worker conditions in their factories."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Beyond our core capability-building offerings, we have long engaged with supply chain sustainability consultants to offer suppliers training and programs focused on topics like work-hours management, occupational health and safety, environmental issues, and prevention of forced and bonded labor."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For more details, see ""Supplier Diversity and Inclusion"" in the Inclusive section of this report."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Supplier Program to Accelerate Responsibility and Commitment (SPARC).
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"This initiative is designed to help our SPARC suppliers build internal capacity around corporate responsibility through rigorous annual commitments to compliance, transparency, and capability-building."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We have increased the number of suppliers required to participate in SPARC over the past eight years as we have broadened our scope to include additional programs and requirements.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,This increase represents suppliers selected using our riskbased approach and those providing critical materials and services to Intel.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Participating suppliers represented over 78% of Intel's managed supply chain spends in 2021.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We continue to raise expectations for our suppliers and expand requirements to encompass a broader set of focus areas.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"While Intel recognizes these categories, they may vary in accordance with local law."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Applying our risk-based approach, we continue to use the RBA program as the industry standard for our validated audits for manufacturing suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In addition, we apply the risk-based criteria to complete targeted assessments of our non-manufacturing suppliers. Our sustainability criteria have also been embedded into our supplier quality assessment process to further extend our reach into the supply chain."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For priority and major findings by category and sub-category, visit the Report Builder."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In certain circumstances, the same facility may be audited multiple times in a calendar year."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We treat each individual audit of a single facility as a unique audit in the above table. Despite continued challenges due to COVID-19, in 2021, over 157 audits were conducted across 89 suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Audits that were planned in 2021 but not executed due to COVID-19 restrictions and still deemed necessary are included in our 2022 plan.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Cumulatively, 627 supplier sites had received audits by the end of 2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Previous years' figures are updated to reflect the most current information as new audit data becomes available.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Supplier Report Card (SRC).
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have a regular review and scoring process for our SRC to grade suppliers for product availability, cost, quality, sustainability (ethics, supplier diversity, and environmental and human rights performance), security, safety, technology, and customer satisfaction."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These processes allow for executive-level dialogue on past and future performance, and remind suppliers of our expectations."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Assessments and Audits.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Supplier assessments and audits cover more than 300 environmental, safety, and human rights factors, and help us determine a supplier's risk profile."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The audits, conducted by a mix of third parties and Intel personnel, follow the RBA VAP and help us identify where immediate action is needed and where longer term, corrective ""targeted action plans"" should be put in place."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, 35% of the combined RBA audits were follow-up or closure audits to verify whether the findings from a previous audit had been addressed."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We strive to audit 100% of high-risk supplier sites within a two-year cycle.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We have instituted a process of unannounced audits to follow up on credible reports of non-compliance, but we did not need to conduct any such audits in 2021."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Targeted Action Plans
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"When a supplier does not make sufficient progress in addressing audit findings or has particularly egregious issues, we work with the supplier to quickly develop and implement a strong corrective action plan."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Supplier progress is reviewed quarterly until we have verified that all key issues have been closed, and that processes have been put in place to prevent recurrence."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If satisfactory progress is not made, we may take additional action, such as not awarding new business (""conditional use"" status) until issues are resolved or— when necessary—ending the supplier relationship."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"While complete closure of some issues can take several years, we work to close egregious issues within 30 days."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We help suppliers with targeted action plans make progress in multiple ways.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our actions may include conducting additional reviews, such as unannounced audits, and increasing the frequency of contact between Intel executives and supplier senior management."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,A short survey is sent to new suppliers to determine whether a facility is of potential high risk. We work with suppliers during the on-boarding process to remedy any issues identified.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Critical and high-risk suppliers4 complete a questionnaire to determine a facility's potential gaps to the RBA Code.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2021, we assessed 374 supplier facilities based on this risk assessment and past performance, a 92% increase from 2020."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,71% of these assessments were managed through the RBA tools and 29% were managed with Intel-specific tools while using the RBA Code of Conduct as the basis for conformance.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Higher risk suppliers must undergo either an onsite audit by qualified third-party auditors who use the RBA VAP, or a qualified Intel auditor."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The latter audits are specialized according to risk and compliance concerns for a particular supplier or facility.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,What we learn from audits helps inform our supplier engagement and capabilitybuilding programs.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The curriculum instructed the companies on human rights principles of the RBA Code of Conduct and their obligation to abide by the RBA Code. 79 suppliers completed this curriculum in 2021.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We provide regular feedback to suppliers on their overall progress and achievements, and integrate corporate responsibility considerations into our Excellence, Partnership, Inclusion, and Continuous Improvement (EPIC) program."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"EPIC recognizes suppliers that have demonstrated outstanding, distinguished, and valued performance."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For more information and a list of recently recognized suppliers, visit our Top 100 Production and Service Suppliers in the Appendix of this report."

Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We will provide opportunities for everyone to learn about sustainability, and to share ideas on how they can integrate sustainability into their practices."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Embedding sustainability into every purchase.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We can leverage the collaborations between procurement staff and suppliers, looking for opportunities to integrate sustainability into contracts, the Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers and beyond."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We want to enable Purchasing staff to access robust ESG data and make sustainability a meaningful metric in the decision-making matrix.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Advancing end-to-end transparency of our supply chains to identify hotspots in the supply chain where more sustainable alternatives can be sourced.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Through the Dow Code of Conduct, we continue to engage new suppliers globally and communicate our expectations that all suppliers are compliant with regulations and Dow's values."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also continually review and refresh the Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers, completing a full analysis of our current standards and industry best practices to ensure that we're holding our suppliers to the highest standards regarding sustainability, human rights, and environmental health and safety."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"The requirements of the Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers are built into all new and existing supplier contracts, to ensure they are contractually enforceable."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Dow reserves the right to audit supplier compliance at any time.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In the case where we identify less-than-adequate supplier practices, we reserve the right to discontinue business with the supplier."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Annually, we've identified compliance issues in less than 0.1% of our supplier base, resulting in the immediate cessation of business."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2020, Integrated Supply Chain (ISC) launched a new sustainability strategy, which builds from previous efforts, while taking into account Dow's aggressive sustainability targets."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Dow's Transportation Stewardship Program is an extensive, holistic program focused on driving the industry toward a new standard of transportation safety and security."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Dow achieved a number of milestones in 2020 by implementing several initiatives that support our commitment to strengthen transportation safety to reduce risk to people and the planet.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We made significant investment in temperature telematics and temperature monitoring equipment to our transportation equipment.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These investments enable nearly real-time monitoring of temperature-sensitive products, so we can react before a deviation causes a safety concern."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In Europe, the smart container implementation was completed in 2020, and there were no emergency events caused by either high- or low-temperature events."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We invested considerable time in 2020 to reduce transportation incidents that had the potential to be more serious than they were (potential transportation incidents).
Supply Chain Labor Standards,The 2020 program created several joint teams between Dow and logistics service providers to address issues before they escalate in severity.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Dow is following the ""4R"" principles (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Replace) in packaging design and packaging supplier selection, to reduce the carbon footprint in packaging material production and packaging product transportation."

Supply Chain Labor Standards,"With the new stretch wrap film, plastic consumption can be reduced by 50% for each pallet load, resulting in emissions savings of 2.35 metric tons of CO2e for 1 metric ton of stretch film material."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Dow continues to find opportunities to reuse drums when a PE liner is inserted into the drum before product filling.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"After the liners are disposed by the consumer site, clean drums are ready for return and reuse."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,A PE liner is 1-2 kg in weight in comparison with disposing a whole drum.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Thus, the material savings by reuse is significant."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Dow Europe has also supported the purchasing of reconditioned IBCs.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"With a reconditioned package such as an IBC, all components (such as the inner container, screw cap and the outlet valve) that came in contact with the previous product that filled it are either replaced with new original components or thoroughly cleaned."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,External manufacturing (EM) refers to manufacturing services that are performed by an outside party on Dow's behalf using Dow's intellectual property.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"In 2020, Dow collaborated with more than 200 external manufacturers globally, spending over $0.5 billion on a diverse portfolio of technologies."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"All EMs are managed through a robust, risk-based work process that includes a screening of process risks, an initial on-site Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) audit, and regular subsequent EH&S audits."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,EM contract agreements also specify that the manufacturer comply with Dow's Code of Business Conduct.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Dow is an active member of the Global Logistics Emissions Council, a group convened by Smart Freight Centre to drive supply chain emissions reductions through global, harmonized guidelines for reporting and reducing logistics emissions."

Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Additionally, within CSBG, our Reliant product line offers new and refurbished non-leading edge products in deposition, etch and clean markets for those applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Deposition processes create layers of dielectric (insulating) and metal (conducting) materials used to build a semiconductor device.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Depending on the type of material and structure being made, different techniques are employed."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Plasma-enhanced CVD, high-density plasma CVD, and ALD are used to form the critical insulating layers that isolate and protect all of these electrical structures. Lastly, post-deposition treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing are used to improve dielectric film properties."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues. "
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We perform supplier audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and our Code of Conduct."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To achieve our 2030 RISE goals, we will significantly expand the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and value for our business.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We have set additional spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers by 100% to reach $2 billion in annual spending by 2030.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Continuing in 2022, we will only retain or use outside law firms in the US that are above average on diversity for their equity partners."
Supply Chain Labor Standards," We are applying a similar rule to firms used by our tax department, including non-legal firms."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied's ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Applied's business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers and contract manufacturers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Significant and sudden increases in demand for Applied's products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture Applied's products."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers' ability to meet our demand requirements."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts, materials or services, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied's manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As more fully discussed in the risk factor ""The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied's operations and financial results"" above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied's supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied's customers, suppliers and partners globally."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If a supplier fails to meet Applied's requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection, sociallyresponsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may impair Applied's ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its intellectual property rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers' and other third parties."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,These outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject Applied to legal proceedings and claims.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If Applied is unable to meet its customers' demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, its business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain Applied's manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact Applied's working capital."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If actual demand for Applied's products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If Applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We rely on our supply chain to provide components, subassemblies, systems and services that are critical to our products, and our ability to deliver on customer orders."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"developing customers and/or suppliers, who may have limited access to capital resources."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing collaboration across our industry on responsible minerals sourcing."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes;
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"supply tools, equipment, and IP for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services;"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"From time to time we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including the following:"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, manmade or natural disasters, operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers;"
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, which can cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, and damage our customer relationships."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"During 2021, the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity, and we anticipate that such shortages will continue in 2022."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These shortages have limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, such as for our PSG products, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, including in our CCG and DCG businesses, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,It is difficult to predict the future impact of these ongoing shortages.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have increasingly entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These arrangements could still prove inadequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"If future customer demand over the horizon of these arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to increase our use of thirdparty foundries for manufacturing, which will include modular tiles manufactured on advanced foundry process technologies for use in our core computing offerings."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Delays in the development of foundries' future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"For example, ASML is currently the sole supplier of EUV photolithography tools that we will be deploying in our Intel 4 and other future manufacturing process nodes."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia."
Supply Chain Labor Standards,Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers.
Supply Chain Labor Standards,"Sole- or limited-source suppliers can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us and intensify the other risks described in this risk factor."

Ownership and Control,"Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, inflation and rising interest rates in various regions, could materially adversely impact Applied's operating results."
Ownership and Control,Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products.
Ownership and Control,"Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions that result in decreases in consumer spending and demand or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results."
Ownership and Control,"The COVID-19 pandemic, and transportation interruptions and other measures taken in response thereto, have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the global and regional economic activity, as well as our ability to meet our customer demand."
Ownership and Control,"Similarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products."
Ownership and Control,"Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers' ability to meet our demand requirements."
Ownership and Control,"Lunar New Year and other holidays in the countries in which we or our suppliers operate may reduce the level of business activities during such times, and thus adversely impact our and our suppliers' ability to manufacture and deliver products, supplies and services."
Ownership and Control,"Accelerated digital transformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an adverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition."
Ownership and Control,"Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied."
Ownership and Control,"Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied's ability to manage operations and deliver its products."
Ownership and Control,"These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied's ability to compete effectively.Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations."
Ownership and Control,"Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied's ability to capitalize on opportunities."
Ownership and Control,"Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings."
Ownership and Control,"Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks."
Ownership and Control,"The risks to Applied's investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges."
Ownership and Control,Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations.
Ownership and Control,"If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied's ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations."
Ownership and Control,Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions.
Ownership and Control,"Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied's strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities."
Ownership and Control,"Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent otherwise, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusiveforum for lawsuits asserting certain stockholder claims (including claims asserted derivatively for our benefit), such as claims againstdirectors and officers for breach of a fiduciary duty, claims arising under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delawareor our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine."
Ownership and Control,This is a general summary of thebylaw provision; you should refer to the language of the bylaws for details.
Ownership and Control,"While the forum provision does not generally apply todirect claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, derivative lawsuits that assert legalclaims arising under these statutes could fall within the provision, as recent court decisions have held.
"
Ownership and Control,"As a Delaware corporation, Delaware law controls issues of our internal affairs, including duties that our directors, officers,employees, and others owe to the Company and its stockholders.
"
Ownership and Control,"We believe that our exclusive forum provision benefits us, and ourstockholders, by permitting relatively prompt resolution of lawsuits concerning our internal affairs, promoting consistent applicationof Delaware law in these lawsuits, and reducing the possibility of duplicative, costly, multi-jurisdictional litigation with the potential for inconsistent outcomes."
Ownership and Control,"However, the forum provision limits a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believesmay be more favorable than Delaware, and this could discourage the filing of such lawsuits."
Biodiversity and Land Use,Promotion of activities for biodiversity conservation on and off the premises of Toshiba sites
Biodiversity and Land Use,Activities for biodiversity conservation: Carried out activities to achieve the Aichi Targets at 61 sites worldwide.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Under the Environmental Future Vision 2050 and the Seventh Environmental Action Plan, we will contribute to the creation of a society where humans live in harmony with nature and continue to enjoy the blessings of ecosystems by promoting compliance with policies and regulations on chemical substance management in countries around the world, proper management of water resources, and activities to conserve biodiversity on and off the premises of Toshiba sites."

Biodiversity and Land Use,Corporate staff divisions draft and formulate Group-wide policies and regulations related to environmental compliance management.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"In accordance with such policies and regulations, each Group company sets its compliance management items to be observed by its business divisions and sites, and executes its business."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"In addition, corporate staff divisions conduct in-house environmental audits to meticulously check whether environmental policies are in place and how relevant laws and regulations are managed at key Group companies, business divisions, and sites on a regular basis."
Biodiversity and Land Use,This helps us identify potential environmental risks and implement measures to prevent environmental incidents and violations of laws.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"If a major environmental risk is identified, the Risk Compliance Committee, chaired by the executive officer in charge of the Legal Division, discusses preventive measures to be taken."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"If any environmental risk should materialize, all the concerned parties, including environmental promotion managers and related persons of relevant Group companies and sites, will work together under the direction of the executive in charge of environment to take preventive measures, check relevant business and production sites as well as consider recurrence prevention measures."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"To manage environmental risks and ensure compliance, we make the most of opportunities such as Company-wide environmental education, environmental auditor certification training , and the Corporate Environmental Management Committee meeting to share the latest trends in laws and regulations, incidents occurred within the Group, and audit results for each Group company, business division, and site."
Biodiversity and Land Use,This has contributed to raising the awareness of compliance.

Biodiversity and Land Use,Many of the products that Walmart sells—from bananas to cotton sheets to shampoo—come from nature or depend on ingredients that come from nature.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Nature provides services and resources to product supply chains and the wider economy worth around $125 trillion per year, according to WWF."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"These include climate regulation, storm and flood protection, clean water, erosion and soil regulation, materials, pollination and energy that are essential to life—and business—on this planet."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Scientists tell us that the world has pushed its natural resources to the point of crisis, resulting in the degradation and loss of critical landscapes, the eradication of many species of plants and animals, and the acceleration of climate change."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"This growing crisis will impact life generally, including in the communities where we operate and in the places where products we sell originate."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Without action, this degradation of resources could make certain products too expensive to produce or make them altogether unavailable."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"And natural services we all rely on like water and air purification, crop pollination and disease control could be at risk."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Our stakeholders have called for Walmart and others to transform product supply chains toward a regenerative approach — one that restores, renews and replenishes nature — to help reverse negative trends and sustain critical resources for the future."
Biodiversity and Land Use,Scientists estimate that a regenerative approach to agriculture and the restoration of nature can also provide around a third of the solution to climate change.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Walmart and companies like us need to be part of the solution to maintain our social license to operate, uphold supply and continue to access the natural capital we all need to thrive."
Biodiversity and Land Use,Walmart works with our suppliers and others to increase the adoption of sustainable and regenerative practices in supply chains.

Biodiversity and Land Use,"Using our purchasing power to source products more sustainably, including by leveraging product certifications that credibly advance sustainability"
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Engaging our suppliers and others to continually improve practices in ways that promote forest, field and ocean health"
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Investing in tools and programs that promote systemic change - for example, certifications and standards; traceability and transparency tools; and the capacity to shift practices"
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Our efforts to better manage, conserve and restore nature focus on critical landscapes and seascapes that have high value for nature, relate to our product sourcing footprint and afford opportunities for Walmart, our suppliers, or non-governmental organization (NGO) collaborators to influence change."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"In 2005, Walmart committed to preserve at least one acre of natural habitat for every acre of land developed by the company in the U.S. through the Walmart Acres for America program, administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF)."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"NFWF reports that the program has since become one of the most effective public-private land conservation partnership in the U.S., helping to conserve more than 1.6 million acres of land since inception."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"In 2020, Walmart Acres for America awarded nearly $3.4 million in grants for projects in Arizona, Hawaii, California, Tennessee, Maine, Virginia and Ohio for the protection of more than 118,500 acres."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"The 1.6 million acres conserved through the end of FY2021 is several times greater than the total number of acres Walmart U.S. has developed, and the acres conserved in recent years far outpaces the number of acres Walmart has developed over that period."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"As a retailer, the primary way we can help to protect, responsibly manage and restore natural resources is through the products we purchase and sell."
Biodiversity and Land Use,Our sourcing teams seek to procure products and ingredient lines that support our regenerative ambitions and advance our nature goals.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"In some instances, credible third-party certifications help us validate that products meet a standard that is more sustainable than conventional products."
Biodiversity and Land Use,Certifications can help suppliers focus on practices that improve sustainability and can provide third-party validation that the standards have been met.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"In supply chains lacking credible or scalable certifications, we may encourage suppliers to use other tools and strategies to support continuous improvement toward sustainability."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"We have a goal that by 2025, all Walmart U.S., Sam's Club U.S., Asda,165 Walmart Canada, Walmart Mexico and Walmart Central America suppliers of farmed and wild-caught seafood—fresh and frozen—will source from fisheries that are third-party certified as sustainable, actively working toward certification, or engaged in fishery improvement projects."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"As of the end of FY2021 (based on supplier reports), we have achieved nearly 100% for Walmart U.S.166 and Sam's Club U.S.167, respectively."

Biodiversity and Land Use,Palm oil is an ingredient found in a variety of food and consumer products and widely used as cooking oil in many parts of the world.
Biodiversity and Land Use,"According to the World Wildlife Fund, high demand for palm oil has contributed to deforestation and climate change."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Walmart set a goal for our private brand products with palm oil to be 100% sourced with zero net deforestation in accordance with the principles and criteria of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), or equivalent standards, by 2020."
Biodiversity and Land Use,We asked our suppliers to help us reach this goal by doing three things:
Biodiversity and Land Use,Source 100% RSPO mass balance or segregated certified sustainable palm oil in all Walmart private brand food and consumables products
Biodiversity and Land Use,Incorporate an RSPO mass balance or segregated certification requirement into product specifications as items are created and bid and update existing specifications when necessary
Biodiversity and Land Use,Annually measure and report palm oil use for 100% of Walmart private brand products

Biodiversity and Land Use,"When I joined Ørsted in 2007, offshore wind was still an up-and-coming technology, and we were focused on making it a competitive source of energy. We didn't pay much attention to the many opportunities to support marine life."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Since then, a lot has happened with the way nature is valued in our assets."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"When I first started, our industry was more reactive than proactive on biodiversity and nature conservation matters."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"Fortunately, our mindsets have changed since then, but the biodiversity challenges we face have stayed the same for many years."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"When we build offshore wind farms, we must attempt to avoid areas where birds, fish, or marine mammals are either feeding or resting, or at the very least find ways to mitigate our impacts."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"In my department, we perform environmental impact assessments to identify locations with no environmental obstacles, but over the years, we've increasingly been finding solutions that can positively stimulate local ecosystems."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"I first experienced this approach at our Danish wind farm near the island of Anholt in 2012, where we solved a technical problem with artificial reefs."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"The site had large boulders scattered on the seabed, which made it difficult for us to place the foundations and cables for our wind turbines."
Biodiversity and Land Use,"The authorities wouldn't allow us to relocate the boulders outside the wind farm area due to principles of conservation, so we came up with the idea of stacking the boulders together in piles to create reef-like structures."
Biodiversity and Land Use,This became an important example of biodiversity efforts adding value to our projects
Biodiversity and Land Use,"It really forced us, as a developer, to rethink parts of our solution with nature in mind."
Biodiversity and Land Use,I believe that including such requirements in permits is a powerful tool for governments to achieve positive impact - both in the oceans and on land.

Raw Material Sourcing,"Members met to discuss the socioeconomic impacts of due diligence, the effects of COVID-19 on Responsible Sourcing and Supporting Resilience in artisanal and small scale mining, and the PPA opportunities and priorities for 2021."
Raw Material Sourcing,"In 2020, the International Tin Supply Chain initiative (ITSCI) encountered funding challenges during the height of the global Covid-19 pandemic."
Raw Material Sourcing,"ITSCI supports member companies to implement due diligence by working with governments and civil society and providing expert field, data, risk management and auditing teams."
Raw Material Sourcing,"ITSCI's purpose is to create responsible mineral supply chains that avoid contributing to conflict, human rights abuses, or other risks such as bribery in central Africa."
Raw Material Sourcing,"By offering financial support to this program, Acer along with other companies, are collectively advancing progress in a more responsible cobalt supply chain."
Raw Material Sourcing,We continue to believe that working together as an industry and in partnership with all stakeholders is the most efficient way to enable success at driving.
Raw Material Sourcing,Meaningful improvement in the social and environmental conditions associated with raw materials extraction.
Raw Material Sourcing,"For many years, Acer has been focusing on responsible minerals sourcing, which began with the Conflict Minerals issue in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)."
Raw Material Sourcing,The eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has long been the center of one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
Raw Material Sourcing,"The revenue from the illegal mining and trading of the ores of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (3TG) from the DRC and its adjoining countries is exploited to fund armed groups, and serious human rights abuses are connected to those groups and to the mines."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Over the years, growing evidence has shown that mining is an intensive process involving social and environmental risks that must be managed and involves metals and minerals that extend beyond 3TG and the DRC."
Raw Material Sourcing,Acer is committed to best practices and we expect our supply chain to respect and support internationally recognized human rights movements and to contribute to minimizing social/economic and environmental risks.
Raw Material Sourcing,Acer also requires its suppliers to adhere to the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct and commit to the Acer policy elements below.
Raw Material Sourcing,"As part of this responsible minerals sourcing policy, Acer commits to:"
Raw Material Sourcing,"Identify and prioritize minerals for inclusion in our responsible sourcing strategy (currently 3TG from the DRC and adjoining countries, cobalt from the DRC and tin sourced from Indonesia);"
Raw Material Sourcing,Require that suppliers neither directly nor indirectly finance armed groups in CAHRAs;
Raw Material Sourcing,Require suppliers to conduct due diligence on prioritized minerals in accordance with OECD Guidance and provide routine reporting using the tools developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) to enable supply chain transparency;
Raw Material Sourcing,"Co-work with its supply chain, industry groups (RMI), government, civil society, and other organizations (OECD Responsible Minerals Forum & Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade) to develop supply of conflict-free products when sourcing prioritized minerals that originate in CAHRAs;"
Raw Material Sourcing,"Seek to support organizations that focus on peace negotiations in CAHRAs, a responsible and sustainable minerals trade, and diverse and stable economies;"
Raw Material Sourcing,Publicize Acer's progress on due diligence and supply chain risk mitigation.
Raw Material Sourcing,Acer communicates the following expectations to its suppliers with respect to the responsible sourcing of minerals:
Raw Material Sourcing,Acer suppliers must conduct their operations in a socially and environmentally responsible way.
Raw Material Sourcing,Acer suppliers shall exercise due diligence based on national or international recognized standards or guidance on the source and chain of custody of these priority minerals (such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas) and make their due diligence measures available to Acer upon request.
Raw Material Sourcing,"Beginning with the 2017 calendar year, Acer expects all of its suppliers to only accept tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold from smelters or refiners (SORs) that have been audited and are deemed conformant by the RMAP."
Raw Material Sourcing,"To confirm that suppliers implement our requirements, we work with third-party auditing companies."
Raw Material Sourcing,On-site audits check that minerals are sourced with due diligence and according to our policies.
Raw Material Sourcing,We make all efforts to verify that the materials used to make Acer products are not from conflict minerals.
Raw Material Sourcing,We recognize the climate impact of our raw materials and are continually assessing and developing programs to reduce impacts related to their cultivation and processing.
Raw Material Sourcing,"As of mid-2021, we are working on two key actions:"
Raw Material Sourcing,"Understanding which materials are most carbon intensive and identifying interventions to minimize energy use, and"
Raw Material Sourcing,"Of the raw materials in our portfolio, manmade cellulosic fibers are one of the most energy intensive, with the most energy consumed processing the raw material into fibers and spinning the fibers into yarn."
Raw Material Sourcing,Identifying this area of impact enabled us to assess the manufacturing and energy management practices of manmade cellulosic suppliers in order to set guidance for our sourcing practices.
Raw Material Sourcing,We now work with a select set of manmade cellulosic suppliers that use renewable energy and energy reduction programs.
Raw Material Sourcing,"We also use a small amount of polyester, nylon and elastane — materials that are not only made from fossil fuels, but are also energy intensive to process into yarn."
Raw Material Sourcing,"In light of these issues, we have initiatives in place to reduce our use of these virgin synthetic fibers."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Going forward, we will continue to minimize our use of virgin synthetic materials, opting for more sustainable alternatives, with the intent to reduce our climate impact."
Raw Material Sourcing,We are also developing and implementing initiatives to reduce the petroleum-based inputs in our raw materials.
Raw Material Sourcing,"Noting that cotton, our most significant raw material, is a natural fiber typically grown with synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, we have undertaken efforts to reduce these petroleum-based inputs."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Specifically, we have worked with the Better Cotton Initiative since 2010 to invest in reducing fossil fuel-based chemicals in global cotton agriculture."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Finally, our support of organic cotton farming provides the greatest climate impact reduction related to our raw materials, as those farmers have eliminated petroleum-based chemical use and are maintaining soil health to the certified organic standard."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Our metal and coal assets generate tailings (residues of mineral processing), which are stored in purpose-built tailings storage facilities (TSFs)."
Raw Material Sourcing,TSFs are specially designed reservoirs filled with tailings and water.
Raw Material Sourcing,"We remove water through drains or evaporation while the tailings settle, gradually filling the reservoir."
Raw Material Sourcing,"At this point, we cap, seal, and rehabilitate the TSF."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Glencore is committed to responsible management of its tailings facilities to prevent impacts to human health and safety, the environment, communities, cultural heritage, and infrastructure."
Raw Material Sourcing,"We design, construct, operate and close our TSFs to safeguard lives and prevent the risk of environmental impacts."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Our focus is on strong technical management and review, governance oversight, stakeholder engagement, transparency, and continuous improvement."
Raw Material Sourcing,We have a robust governance process and our Group Tailings Storage Facilities Policy aligns with the Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management (GISTM).
Raw Material Sourcing,"We are committed to implementing the GISTM and also align the design, operation, and closure of our TSFs with other international leading practices We continually review and strengthen our TSFs management system through our catastrophic hazard evaluation programme."
Raw Material Sourcing,To support stakeholder engagement and in the interests of transparency we publish information on our global portfolio of TSFs.
Raw Material Sourcing,This database is available here.
Raw Material Sourcing,We adhere to leading international standards on TSF management and conduct assurance activities to assess and monitor implementation.
Raw Material Sourcing,"We assess our TSFs against seismic and flooding events, including the impacts of climate change, and we incorporate the outcomes into the design and operation of our TSFs."
Raw Material Sourcing,We classify the potential consequences of a failure of our TSFs and the controls required for safe management of our facilities.
Raw Material Sourcing,"Dam failure is the greatest risk for our TSFs, as disclosed in our Annual Report."
Raw Material Sourcing,Our dam safety assurance programme assesses our tailings and water dams in line with international leading practice.
Raw Material Sourcing,Our assets have management systems and dedicated facilities to dispose of mineral residues while preventing environmental contamination.
Raw Material Sourcing,"Through our group-wide dam integrity and safety assurance programme, we require our TSFs to be audited and independently reviewed by Klohn Crippen Berger (KCB), one of the world's leading experts on integrity and safety of tailing storage facilities."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Our assets are required to assess natural phenomena such as extreme flooding and seismic events, as well as operational criteria, and incorporate these factors into their TSF designs."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Since 2016, our corporate dam integrity and safety assurance programme has detailed our approach towards the group-wide review on the integrity of our TSFs."
Raw Material Sourcing,This involves an assessment against more than 100 dam safety and governance leading practice criteria.
Raw Material Sourcing,"Regular surveillance - assets are expected to monitor their TSFs on an ongoing basis using piezometers, slope monitoring and other equipment, with results assessed by the management team of that asset."
Raw Material Sourcing,Dam safety inspections (DSI) - external engineers carry out periodic DSI for operating assets and closed TSFs.
Raw Material Sourcing,"A DSI evaluates and observes potential deficiencies in a TSF's current and past condition, performance, and operation; DSI findings are typically overseen by the asset management team."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Dam safety audits - KCB, one of the world's leading experts, audits and independently reviews the integrity and safety of our TSFs."
Raw Material Sourcing,"The results of these audits are reported to Glencore's senior management and the HSEC Committee of our Board of Directors, and findings are followed up through independent verification audits."
Raw Material Sourcing,"In addition, where appropriate, assets conduct periodic dam safety reviews, which include reviewing maintenance, surveillance and monitoring, failure impact assessments, emergency management procedures, public safety, and environmental management."
Raw Material Sourcing,The results are shared with asset and department management and reviewed as part of the dam safety audits.
Raw Material Sourcing,"As technologies and knowledge evolves, we investigate and, when possible, implement new approaches to the management of our TSFs."
Raw Material Sourcing,"For example, we are migrating some of our existing facilities to filter press tailings, which uses dewatering technologies to produce relatively 'dry' tailings that allow for stable and stackable storage."
Raw Material Sourcing,"However, dry tailings are not suited to all environments and we continue to consider options to improve our TSFs management."
Raw Material Sourcing,"In 2020, we entered into a global agreement with a leading global provider to extend satellite monitoring to over half of our facilities prioritising on a basis of consequence classification."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Satellite monitoring measures our TSFs' surface movements every 11 days, currently the maximum available frequency for this type data collection."
Raw Material Sourcing,"The data is available via a cloud-based platform, ensuring its continuous availability and the ability for rapid decision making in the event of unexpected movements, as well as supporting independent oversight by our corporate and external auditors."
Raw Material Sourcing,"While the focus of the satellite monitoring programme is our TSFs, some of our assets use the data to supplement other terrestrial monitoring techniques for their operational activities, such as open pits, waste piles and areas prone to subsidence."
Raw Material Sourcing,Glencore participated in the development of the GISTM through our membership of the ICMM.
Raw Material Sourcing,"All of our TSFs with ""Extreme"" or ""Very high"" potential consequences will be in conformance with the GISTM by 5 August 2023."
Raw Material Sourcing,All of our other TSFs not in a state of safe closure will be in conformance with the GISTM by 5 August 2025.
Raw Material Sourcing,ICMM has provided a clear indication of this commitment here and further information on its members' TSFs is available here.
Raw Material Sourcing,We welcomed the opportunity to participate in the Investor Mining & Tailings Safety Initiative from its outset.
Raw Material Sourcing,"In March 2022, we updated the information in our TSF database to reflect status of our TSF portfolio, including the divestment of assets."
Raw Material Sourcing,"We now report on 107 TSFs (103 excluding non-operated joint ventures), down from the previously disclosed 122 TSFs in 2021."
Raw Material Sourcing,We have also included additional explanatory notes to show our progress on key dam upgrades and where we have further strengthened our management systems.
Raw Material Sourcing,"We have established an online Tailings Manager Academy (TMA) that builds on our employees' existing knowledge and skills and increases their capacity for decision-making on the design, construction, operation, monitoring and maintenance of TSFs."
Raw Material Sourcing,"The TMA has been tailored to three different levels for ranging from operators and technicians to responsible persons and engineers to dam owners, managers, and accountable executives."
Raw Material Sourcing,"For our Responsible Persons there are twelve learning modules including technical, governance, environment, closure, emergency-response planning, and stakeholder engagement aspects."
Raw Material Sourcing,"We require our assets to undertake proactive, targeted stakeholder and community engagement across a broad range of operational topics, including TSFs where appropriate, throughout the asset's lifecycle."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Our local engagement activities support the building of the community's knowledge about how we manage our tailings facilities and, where appropriate, they support stakeholder participation in decisions that may have a bearing on public safety."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Our assets implement local level complaints and grievance processes, where citizens can raise concerns or complaints in relation to TSFs and our teams will investigate and seek to resolve them in a timely and consultative manner."
Raw Material Sourcing,We require our assets to develop and maintain emergency preparedness and response plans.
Raw Material Sourcing,"The EPRP Guideline provides information on managing emergency response to a TSF failure event that presents a risk to people and the environment, including the mitigation of risks in the preparations for a TSF failure."
Raw Material Sourcing,Assets communicate their emergency preparedness and response plans with relevant stakeholders.
Raw Material Sourcing,"Where appropriate, assets may also engage with local and regional emergency response services in scenario planning and practice exercises."
Raw Material Sourcing,"As the mine approaches the end of its life, closure plans are developed, which include the decommissioning of TSFs."
Raw Material Sourcing,These closure plans are developed in accordance with local and international guidelines and are approved through the regulatory process where required.
Raw Material Sourcing,We are also in the process of reviewing the latest guidance from ICMM in relation to mine closure plans.
Raw Material Sourcing,"When we decommission and close our TSFs, we require that assets put in place appropriate measures for physical and geochemical stability and that the rehabilitation of the land for appropriate post-mining land use in a manner that enhances stability."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Following closure, TSFs are inspected and monitored by dedicated teams on a regular basis. Our sites are required to have operational manuals that include instructions on actions in case of an abnormality, emergency response, monitoring, etc."
Raw Material Sourcing,Our corporate dam safety assurance programme includes closed assets.
Raw Material Sourcing,"To ensure sustainable procurement of forest resources, Mitsui Home Co., Ltd. as a company using such resources has formulated the Mitsui Home Group Resource Procurement Guidelines."
Raw Material Sourcing,"The guidelines outline Mitsui Home's procurement policies and their scope of applicability, and are aimed at maintaining abundant ecosystems, sustaining local communities, practicing strictly sustainable procurement of forest resources, and contributing to reducing our global environmental load."
Raw Material Sourcing,"As a company that draws on trees and forests in the conduct of its business activities, Mitsui Homes adheres strictly to a policy of sustainable forest resource procurement to ensure an abundant ecosystem and to maintain regional society."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Moving forward, the company will work diligently to reduce its global environmental load."

Raw Material Sourcing,"We work with partners to manage and promote legal, sustainable supply chains."
Raw Material Sourcing,"The Group promotes the 3Rs, and appropriately disposes of wastes that cannot be reused or recycled based on laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to appropriate disposal of wastes."
Raw Material Sourcing,"In the Office Building Division, we make every effort to ensure that waste is disposed of appropriately, and to this end we conduct on-site inspections of our industrial waste management subcontractors, which are required to cooperate based on the Waste Disposal and Public Cleansing Act."
Raw Material Sourcing,"In the Retail Properties Division, from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012, we confirmed that waste was properly disposed of at our retail properties in Japan, completing any adjustments to our agreements with waste management subcontractors."
Raw Material Sourcing,We audit and inspect numerous retail properties annually to ensure compliance with adjusted waste disposal agreements.
Raw Material Sourcing,"In 2021, we conducted energy efficiency audits at select facilities to identify opportunities for energy savings through equipment upgrades and better building management practices."
Raw Material Sourcing,"This analysis covered over 30% of our global square footage across stages, studios, and offices and identified cost-saving energy efficiency opportunities across our facilities."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Next, we electrify the equipment that uses the most liquid fuels, like vehicles, buildings and generators."
Raw Material Sourcing,"For instance, where we can, we use electric motors because they're more efficient and electricity is more easily decarbonized."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Then, for emissions sources where optimization and electrification aren't possible, we decarbonize what's left by installing and purchasing renewable energy. This means matching renewable electricity to any grid-connected power that isn't carbon-free and shifting to lower-carbon or zero-carbon fuel options when connecting to the grid isn't possible."
Raw Material Sourcing,"We look for renewable energy options in the following order of preference: 1) onsite solar+storage, 2) utility provided green tariff programs, 3) direct investment or purchase agreements for offsite wind or solar, 4) unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates."
Raw Material Sourcing,We don't own the majority of our office and stage space - we lease them.
Raw Material Sourcing,So we're not often able to procure renewable electricity directly.
Raw Material Sourcing,"In some countries, direct renewable electricity purchasing is not available, so we purchase renewable attribute certificates in those countries."
Raw Material Sourcing,And we explore ways to bring new renewable electricity generation to regions we operate in by investing in new projects and products.
Raw Material Sourcing,"Fuel consumption makes up a large proportion of our Scope 1 emissions, and due to the nature of our business and operations, presents unique challenges to decarbonize."
Raw Material Sourcing,"We follow our internal reduction framework above of ""Optimize, Electrify and Decarbonize"" to tackle these hard-to-abate emissions."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Optimize fuel consumption: For corporate offices, this focuses mostly on efficient creation and capture of building heat, and on the production side, can range from optimizing the size of diesel generators or reducing how long vehicles idle."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Electrify vehicles, buildings, and generators: Incorporating electric vehicles into production fleets and installing EV charging infrastructure at studios are critical to reducing emissions."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Up to 70% of the fuel used by productions goes into vehicles, therefore electrifying a significant portion of the production fleet will be essential over the coming decade."
Raw Material Sourcing,Decarbonize through fuel switching: We recognize that not everything can be solved with efficiency or electrification.
Raw Material Sourcing,"For these use cases, Netflix is piloting ways to transition away from heavy emitting fossil fuels towards low and zero emissions fuels like renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and green hydrogen."

Raw Material Sourcing,"TSMC's production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. "
Raw Material Sourcing,"In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific vendors or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. "
Raw Material Sourcing,"Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. "
Raw Material Sourcing,"Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company's needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. "
Raw Material Sourcing,Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality.
Raw Material Sourcing,"In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. "
Raw Material Sourcing,TSMC's revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials.
Raw Material Sourcing,"To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage the cost effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Further, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants and to improve their cost competitiveness by moving their production facilities to Taiwan from higher-cost areas."
Raw Material Sourcing,"Given that qualified backup suppliers are hard to find, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production when the Company lacks sufficient time to re-tune its production process. "
Raw Material Sourcing,"For leading technology nodes, TSMC not only adopts world-class processes and facilities but also requires world-class materials. "
Raw Material Sourcing,"To streamline supply chain risk, the Company has increased supplier site audits and meetings to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. "

Access to Finance,"Our Sales to Customers in China, a Region of Growing Significance to Us, Could be Materially and Adversely Affected byExport License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the TradeRelationship Between the U.S. and China."
Access to Finance,China represents a large and fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to ourbusiness.
Access to Finance,"Revenue in China, which includes global customers and domestic Chinese customers with manufacturing facilities inChina, represented approximately 35%, 31%, and 22% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
"
Access to Finance,TheU.S. and China have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the twocountries.
Access to Finance,"Recently, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government,which have limited the market for our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreigncompetition, and could potentially do so to an even greater extent in the future.
"
Access to Finance,"For example, over the course of calendar year 2020,the U.S. Department of Commerce enacted a new rule that expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certainitems to companies and other end-users in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could supportmilitary end uses, added additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list (including Semiconductor ManufacturingInternational Corporation, or SMIC, and related entities), and expanded an existing rule (referred to as the foreign direct productrule) in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items produced with many of our products tobe subject to U.S. licensing requirements if Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (""Huawei"") or its affiliates are parties to a transactioninvolving the items.
"
Access to Finance,"These rules have required and may require us to apply for and obtain additional export licenses to supplycertain of our products to specified customers in China, such as SMIC (where those products would not otherwise require an exportlicense to China), and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all."
Access to Finance,"In addition,our customers (including but not limited to Chinese customers) may require U.S. export licenses for the use of our products in orderto manufacture products, including semiconductor wafers and integrated circuits, for those of their customers (i.e. Huawei and itsaffiliates) that are subject to the expanded foreign direct product rule, which may adversely impact the demand for our products.

"
Access to Finance,TheU.S. Department of Commerce could in the future add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list or take other actionsthat could expand licensing requirements or otherwise impact the market for our products and our revenue.
Access to Finance,"The implementation,interpretation and impact on our business of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government is uncertain andevolving, and these rules, other regulatory actions or changes, and other actions taken by the governments of either the U.S. orChina, or both, that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations."
Access to Finance,"Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional TaxLiabilitiesWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significantjudgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities."
Access to Finance,"The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in variousjurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability."
Access to Finance,"As a global company, our effectivetax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region."
Access to Finance,"Oureffective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates,in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or by changes in or expirations ofagreements with tax authorities."
Access to Finance,These factors could affect our profitability.
Access to Finance,"In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets,which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States."
Access to Finance,Recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shiftingproject have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries.
Access to Finance,"In addition, President Joseph Biden has madeseveral corporate income tax proposals, including a significant increase to the U.S. corporate income tax rate and changes in thetaxation of non-U.S. income.

Responsible Investment,"In a highly concentrated business environment, if a particular customer does not place an order, or if they delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business. Furthermore, because our process control and yield management products are configured to each customer's specifications, any changes, delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs."
Responsible Investment,"As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage. Many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative, second-source suppliers for the products we offer and, in addition, may seek and, on occasion, receive pricing, payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business. Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices,customer orders, revenues and gross margins. "
Responsible Investment,"Certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions. Any future change in ownership or management of our existing customers may result in similar challenges, including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor's products."
Responsible Investment,"The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers. For example, as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and in some cases continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers. To the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional credit losses with respect to receivables owed to us bythose customers. In addition, customers with liquidity issues may be forced to reduce purchases of our equipment, delay deliveries of our products, discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers, and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base. "
Responsible Investment,"Semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify, install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's process control and yield management equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment. "
Responsible Investment,"Prices differ among the products we offer for different applications due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. If there is a shift in demand by our customers from our higher-priced to lower-priced products, our gross margin and revenues would decrease. In addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin."
Responsible Investment,"We operate in industries that have historically been cyclical, including the semiconductor industry."
Responsible Investment,The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide.
Responsible Investment,"If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted."
Responsible Investment,"The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict."
Responsible Investment,"The historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry in which we primarily operate is largely a function of our customers' capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity, which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization, consumer demand for products, inventory levels and our customers' access to capital."
Responsible Investment,"Cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, in some cases, future expense levels."
Responsible Investment,"During down cycles in our industry, the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted, which could result not only in a decrease in, or cancellation or delay of, orders (which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty) but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers."
Responsible Investment,"Our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer's funding status, which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or company-specific reasons, but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer's unique organizational structure."
Responsible Investment,"Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition."
Responsible Investment,"When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound."
Responsible Investment,"During periods of declining revenues, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees."
Responsible Investment,"If we fail to respond, or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results, then our business could be seriously harmed."
Responsible Investment,"Furthermore, any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand."
Responsible Investment,We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
Responsible Investment,Each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.
Responsible Investment,"In addition, our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics, which, when made, are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time."
Responsible Investment,"However, largely due to the historical cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate, and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles, our actual results may vary (and have varied in the past) from forecasted results."
Responsible Investment,"These variations can occur for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders, product shipments or product acceptance; an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions; or a different than anticipated effective tax rate."
Responsible Investment,The impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment.
Responsible Investment,"This is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues, but also, due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order to meet the expected lead times, to significant inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin."
Responsible Investment,Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided.
Responsible Investment,"We provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management's expectations for the future, but those reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of, and are themselves, forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this Item 1A and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements."
Responsible Investment,"If our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we revise our forecasts, the market price of our common stock could decline."
Responsible Investment,"While it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our income tax liability."
Responsible Investment,"Compliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ requirements, has become increasingly complex, and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business."
Responsible Investment,"Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations."
Responsible Investment,"These laws, rules and regulations have increased, and in the future are expected to continue to increase, the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations."
Responsible Investment,"A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices (or changes in interpretations of such standards, practices or rules) can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective."
Responsible Investment,New accounting standards and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future.
Responsible Investment,Changes to (or revised interpretations or applications of) existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
Responsible Investment,"Adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes, accounting systems, and internal controls."
Responsible Investment,"Ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks."
Responsible Investment,"The industries that we serve, including the semiconductor, FPD and PCB industries, are constantly developing and changing over time."
Responsible Investment,"Many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies, such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve, pricing trends in the end markets for consumer electronics and other products (which place a growing emphasis on our customers' cost of ownership), changes in our customers' capital spending patterns and, in general, an environment of constant change and development, including decreasing product and component dimensions; use of new materials; and increasingly complex device structures, applications and process steps."
Responsible Investment,"If we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends, or, with respect to technological advances, if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry, as a significant majority of our sales are our process control and yield management products sold to semiconductor manufacturers."
Responsible Investment,"the potential for reversal of the long-term historical trend of declining cost per transistor with each new generation of technological advancement within the semiconductor industry, and the adverse impact that such reversal may have upon our business."
Responsible Investment,the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers' capital equipment investment decisions.
Responsible Investment,"differing market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications, such as memory and foundry/logic."
Responsible Investment,lower level of process control adoption by our memory customers compared to our foundry/logic customers.
Responsible Investment,"our customers' reuse of existing and installed products, which may decrease their need to purchase new products or solutions at more advanced technology nodes."
Responsible Investment,"the emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes (or the economics associated with semiconductor manufacturing) and, as a result, also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes."
Responsible Investment,"the higher design costs for the most advanced ICs, which could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large, technologically advanced products and applications."
Responsible Investment,the possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor manufacturing processes.
Responsible Investment,"changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are extremely costly for our customers to implement and, accordingly, our customers could reduce their available budgets for process control equipment by reducing inspection and metrology sampling rates for certain technologies."
Responsible Investment,the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into (a) leading edge manufacturers driving continued R&D into next-generation products and technologies and (b) other manufacturers that are content with existing (including previous generation) products and technologies.
Responsible Investment,"the ever escalating cost of next-generation product development, which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to help fund such programs that could restrict our control of, ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs."
Responsible Investment,"the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity, cost or risk with other manufacturers, as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities, and greater focus only on specific markets or applications, whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures."
Responsible Investment,We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
Responsible Investment,"Our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation, acquisitions and business closures."
Responsible Investment,"In this environment, orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of our sales."
Responsible Investment,"The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers. "
Responsible Investment,"New orders from our foundry/logic customers in the past several years have constituted a significant portion of our total orders. This concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes within the foundry/logic industry may have on our business, financial condition and operating results. "
Responsible Investment,"Even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights, that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk."
Responsible Investment,"Diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering."
Responsible Investment,"Instability in any region could directly impact our ability to operate our business (or our customers' ability to operate their businesses), cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate."
Responsible Investment,Instability in the region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products.
Responsible Investment,"If international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business, our business and results of operations could be harmed."
Responsible Investment,We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.
Responsible Investment,We self-insure certain risks including earthquake risk.
Responsible Investment,"If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss."
Responsible Investment,"We purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks; however, certain risks are uninsurable, are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance."
Responsible Investment,"Accordingly, we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance, either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy."
Responsible Investment,"For example, we do not currently hold earthquake insurance."
Responsible Investment,"An earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, a significant portion of which are conducted in California, an area highly susceptible to earthquakes."
Responsible Investment,"It could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products, much of which is also conducted in California."
Responsible Investment,"We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake."
Responsible Investment,We self-insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market.
Responsible Investment,"Certain other risks are also self-insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance."
Responsible Investment,We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Responsible Investment,"Although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries."
Responsible Investment,"We have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen, the euro, the pound sterling and the Israeli new shekel."
Responsible Investment,We have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally.
Responsible Investment,"In addition, an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the United States, and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies."
Responsible Investment,"We routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations."
Responsible Investment,"To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected."
Responsible Investment,"Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses."
Responsible Investment,"We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments, and an impairment of our investments could harm our earnings."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock."
Responsible Investment,Our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields.
Responsible Investment,"As market interest rates and bond yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss."
Responsible Investment,"An impairment of the fair market value of our investments, even if unrealized, must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years."
Responsible Investment,"The trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors, including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate, fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets, our operating results or other performance metrics, or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A."
Responsible Investment,Volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies.
Responsible Investment,We are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions.
Responsible Investment,"We are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits (such as related to customs or product safety requirements) in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes, penalties, fines or other prohibitions against us."
Responsible Investment,"Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations, the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies."
Responsible Investment,"In addition to and in connection with the Israel Tax Authority (""ITA"") Assessment described in more detail in Note 14 ""Income Taxes"" to our Consolidated Financial Statements, there is an ongoing criminal investigation against our Orbotech subsidiary, certain of its employees and its tax consultant that began prior to the Acquisition Date."
Responsible Investment,We can make no assurances that an indictment will not result from the criminal investigation.
Responsible Investment,The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
Responsible Investment,A change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.
Responsible Investment,"We earn profits in, and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in, the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore, Israel and the Cayman Islands, the countries in which we earn the majority of our non-U.S. profits."
Responsible Investment,"Due to economic, political or other conditions, tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change."
Responsible Investment,"A number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions; expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development (""IPR&D"") and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and the repatriation of earnings from outside the U.S. for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes."
Responsible Investment,A change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations.
Responsible Investment," In addition, recent changes to U.S. tax laws will significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings."
Responsible Investment,"We have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017."
Responsible Investment,"However, the recent U.S. tax law changes are subject to future guidance from U.S. federal and state governments, such as the Treasury Department and/or the IRS."
Responsible Investment,Any future guidance can change our tax liability.
Responsible Investment,A significant portion of the income taxes due to the enactment of the Tax Act is payable by us over a period of eight years.
Responsible Investment,"As a result, our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until tax liability is paid in full."
Responsible Investment,"Numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part, to recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project."
Responsible Investment,"Furthermore, President Biden put forth several corporate income tax proposals during his campaign, including a significant increase in the corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income."
Responsible Investment,"It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered, on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions, or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage."
Responsible Investment,"These providers' cloud computing systems may be susceptible to ""cyber incidents,"" such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, which are outside of our control."
Responsible Investment,"If we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if our third-party service providers do not perform as anticipated, or do not adequately protect our data from cyber related security breaches, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, we may experience operational difficulties (such as limitations on our ability to ship products), increased costs, manufacturing or service interruptions or delays, loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data, quality and compliance issues, and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
Responsible Investment,We depend on secure information technology for our business and are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents affecting our and our service providers' systems and networks.
Responsible Investment,"In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems and networks, including systems and networks owned and maintained by KLA and/or by third-party providers."
Responsible Investment,"This data includes confidential information, transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us, our customers and our business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of individuals."
Responsible Investment,"Despite network security measures, our and our third-party providers' information systems and networks are susceptible to computer viruses, ransomware, cyber-related security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions, tampering, misuse, or criminal acts made directly against, or through our third-party providers in the supply chain, and against, our systems and networks, including phishing, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate, which are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures."
Responsible Investment,"We have experienced cyber-related attacks in the past, and are likely to experience cyber-related attacks in the future."
Responsible Investment,"Our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors, malfeasance, or otherwise."
Responsible Investment,"Third parties may also attempt to influence employees, users, suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our, our customers' or business partners' data."
Responsible Investment,"Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently, may not be recognized until launched against a target, and are increasingly designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection and to remove or obfuscate forensic artifacts, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to adequately identify and investigate cybersecurity incidents."
Responsible Investment,"Any cybersecurity incident or occurrence could impact our business directly, or indirectly by impacting third parties in the supply chain, in many potential ways: disruptions to operations; misappropriation, corruption or theft of confidential information, including intellectual property and other critical data, of KLA, our customers and other business partners; misappropriation of funds and Company assets; reduced value of our investments in research, development and engineering; litigation with, or payment of damages to, third parties; reputational damage; costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions; data privacy issues; costs to rebuild our information systems and networks; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs."
Responsible Investment,"We carry insurance that provides limited protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses, and the losses that it does not cover may be significant."
Responsible Investment,We rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations.
Responsible Investment,Our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations.
Responsible Investment,"Our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications."
Responsible Investment,"System failures or malfunctions, such as difficulties with our customer relationship management system, could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results."
Responsible Investment,"Our enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record transactions, provide critical information to our management, and prepare our financial statements."
Responsible Investment,"Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our ERP system or other systems (whether in connection with the regular operation, periodic enhancements, modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems, or due to cybersecurity events such as ransomware attacks) could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002."
Responsible Investment,"Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition."
Responsible Investment,"Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses."
Responsible Investment,We are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter.
Responsible Investment,"In addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources."
Responsible Investment,"As part of this effort, in February 2019, we announced that we had consummated our Orbotech Acquisition."
Responsible Investment,"We may also enter into definitive agreements for and consummate acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies."
Responsible Investment,There can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful.
Responsible Investment,"In addition, we may use equity to finance future acquisitions, which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders."
Responsible Investment,"If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses, if the costs associated with integrating the acquired business exceeds our expectations, or if acquired businesses perform poorly, then our business and financial results may suffer."
Responsible Investment,"It is possible that the businesses we have acquired, as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future, may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, we may lose key employees of the acquired companies.
"
Responsible Investment,Risks associated with acquisition transactions may lead to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for an additional number of reasons.
Responsible Investment,we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses.
Responsible Investment,"the combination of businesses may result in the loss of key personnel or an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our Company and/or the acquired business."
Responsible Investment,we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions.
Responsible Investment,we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products.
Responsible Investment,"we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities."
Responsible Investment,"the customers, distributors, suppliers, employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition."
Responsible Investment,we may have difficulty implementing a cohesive framework of internal controls over the entire organization.
Responsible Investment,we may have to write-off goodwill or other intangible assets.
Responsible Investment,we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions.
Responsible Investment,"At times, we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property."
Responsible Investment,"These alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary, highly sensitive information."
Responsible Investment,The success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners.
Responsible Investment,"Mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results."
Responsible Investment,"Disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations, or in the operations of our customers, due to earthquake, flood, other natural catastrophic events, health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business."
Responsible Investment,"We have significant manufacturing operations in the United States, Singapore, Israel, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and China."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world."
Responsible Investment,"Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors, as well as our other operations and those of our customers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics and pandemics, fire, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters."
Responsible Investment,"Such disruption could cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites."
Responsible Investment,"We cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations (whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise) would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if such alternate means were available, they could be obtained on favorable terms."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, as part of our cost-cutting actions, we have consolidated several operating facilities."
Responsible Investment,Our California operations are now primarily centralized in our Milpitas facility.
Responsible Investment,"The consolidation of our California operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above, such as acts of war or terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters, if any such event were to impact our Milpitas facility."
Responsible Investment,"If international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed."
Responsible Investment,"The threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets."
Responsible Investment,Any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business.
Responsible Investment,"Increased international political instability in various parts of the world, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations."
Responsible Investment, We maintain significant operations in Israel.
Responsible Investment,"Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic challenges for Israel."
Responsible Investment,"In addition, some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces, and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances."
Responsible Investment,"We cannot assess the impact that emergency conditions in Israel in the future may have on our business, operations, financial condition or results of operations, but it could be material."
Responsible Investment,"The current COVID-19 pandemic and the potential aftereffects from it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations."
Responsible Investment,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial global disruptions, including in the jurisdictions where we conduct business and may cause additional disruptions in the future, which are impossible to predict."
Responsible Investment,"Local, regional and national authorities in numerous jurisdictions have implemented a variety of measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, including social distancing guidelines, quarantines, banning of non-essential travel and requiring the cessation of non-essential activities on the premises of businesses."
Responsible Investment,"While all of our global sites are currently operational, any local pandemic outbreaks could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates."
Responsible Investment,COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and become available for use in the United States and certain other countries.
Responsible Investment,"However, given our global operations, we are unable to predict how widely utilized the vaccines ultimately will be and whether they will be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 (including its variant strains).
"
Responsible Investment,"In addition, although economic activity has begun to improve in recent months from the global reduction in economic activity in calendar year 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies, and the resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain as discussed below."
Responsible Investment,"cancellation or reduction of routes available from common carriers, which may cause delays in our ability to deliver or service our products or receive components from suppliers necessary to manufacture or service our products."
Responsible Investment,"shortages or disruption in the supply chain could affect our ability to procure components for our products on a timely basis or at all, or could require us to commit to increased purchases and provide longer lead times to secure critical components, which could increase inventory obsolescence risk (refer to the Executive Summary in Part II, Item 7 ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" for additional information on supply constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic)."
Responsible Investment,"travel bans or the requirement to quarantine for a lengthy period after entering a jurisdiction, which may delay our ability to install the products we sell or service those products following installation."
Responsible Investment,"governmental orders or employee exposure requiring us, our customers or our suppliers to discontinue manufacturing products at our respective facilities for a period of time."
Responsible Investment,"reduced demand for our products, delivery pushouts or cancellation of orders by our customers caused by a global recession resulting from the pandemic and the measures implemented by authorities to slow the spread of COVID-19."
Responsible Investment,increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products due to reduced availability.
Responsible Investment,"absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers caused by disruptions from the pandemic, which may hamper the ability of customers to pay for the products they purchase on time or at all, or hamper the ability of our suppliers to continue to supply components to us in a timely manner or at all."
Responsible Investment, loss of efficiencies due to remote working requirements for our employees.
Responsible Investment,"If any of the foregoing risks occur or intensify during this pandemic, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected."
Responsible Investment,"A majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the United States, and we maintain significant operations outside the United States. "
Responsible Investment,We are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations.
Responsible Investment,We expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future. 
Responsible Investment,"global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes."
Responsible Investment,"political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors."
Responsible Investment,ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries.
Responsible Investment,managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment.
Responsible Investment,"exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global market, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period."
Responsible Investment,periodic local or international economic downturns.
Responsible Investment,"potential adverse tax consequences, including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings, and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business."
Responsible Investment,compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business.
Responsible Investment,"existing and potentially new tariffs or other trade restrictions and barriers (including those applied to our products, spare parts and services, or to parts and supplies that we purchase)."
Responsible Investment,"political instability, natural disasters, legal or regulatory changes, acts of war or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business."
Responsible Investment,"fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of our near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate."
Responsible Investment,"our ability to receive prepayments for certain of our products and services sold in certain jurisdictions. These prepayments increase our cash flows for the quarter in which they are received. If our practice of requiring prepayments in those jurisdictions changes or deteriorates, our cash flows would be harmed. "
Responsible Investment,longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the United States.
Responsible Investment,difficulties in managing foreign distributors (including monitoring and ensuring our distributors' compliance with applicable laws).
Responsible Investment, inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions.
Responsible Investment,"In addition, government controls, either by the United States or other countries, that restrict our business overseas or restrict our ability to import or export our products and services or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs, new controls, outright bans, or otherwise, could harm our business.
"
Responsible Investment,"For example, Commerce has added numerous Chinabased entities to the U.S."
Responsible Investment,"Entity List, including Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, Ltd., Huawei, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license."
Responsible Investment,Even if we apply for licenses to sell our products or provide services to companies on Commerce's U.S.
Responsible Investment,"Entity List, there can be no assurance that licenses will be granted.
"
Responsible Investment,"In addition, Commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on China-based customers engaged in military end uses or where Commerce has determined there is a risk of diversion to a military end use, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to Huawei or its affiliates."
Responsible Investment,"To date, these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations, but we are continually monitoring their impact."
Responsible Investment,"If additional companies are added to Commerce's U.S. Entity List, or other licensing requirements or restrictions are imposed, thereby limiting our ability to sell our products or services to other customers in China, our business could be significantly harmed."
Responsible Investment,Similar actions by the U.S. government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers.
Responsible Investment,Any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
Responsible Investment,We are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy.
Responsible Investment,Demand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses.
Responsible Investment,"Economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending, and can cause our customers to decrease, cancel or delay their equipment and service orders."
Responsible Investment,"The tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit can make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell."
Responsible Investment,"Reduced demand, combined with delays in our customers' ability to obtain financing (or the unavailability of such financing), has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results, and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels."
Controversial Sourcing,"The Company recognizes the importance of the responsible procurement of raw materials when sourced from regions experiencing political and social conflict, which may include the conflict minerals of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or surrounding countries. Since 2012, the Company has adhered to the following efforts and expects its product procurement and ODM suppliers to do the same:"
Controversial Sourcing,Comply with the intentions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 'Dodd-Frank 1502 Rule' even if not directly regulated by the U.S. SEC
Controversial Sourcing,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Sourcing Materials from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas
Controversial Sourcing,"In FY 2020/21, it conducted extensive due diligence for its cobalt supply chain using the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) and the RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP)."
Controversial Sourcing,"The Company will coordinate with the RMI as they perform risk profiles on other materials, assess their content in its products, and further develop due diligence efforts to mitigate supply chain risk."
Controversial Sourcing,These efforts were initiated through RMI's coordination with the 'Drive Sustainability' organization which has already developed risk profiles on over 30 materials in the technology and automotive industry.
Controversial Sourcing,"For more information, please visit the Lenovo Responsible Sourcing webpage."
Controversial Sourcing,"Like many technology companies, Micron relies on the use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) in the manufacture of our products."
Controversial Sourcing,"These materials, known as conflict minerals, are abundant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries, a region that has endured sustained conflict and human rights violations."
Controversial Sourcing,We recognize that these and other raw materials are subject to controversy based on social and environmental concerns regarding how they are obtained.
Controversial Sourcing,"With this in mind, our program assesses and reviews other rare earth elements, metals and materials used in our processes to understand global risks related to human rights, potential restrictions, availability, pricing and implications to manufacturing processes and products while focusing expanded due diligence on worldwide 3TG minerals."
Controversial Sourcing,Micron is committed to ensuring that minerals used in the manufacture of our products do not directly or indirectly fund violence or human rights abuses in the DRC or adjoining countries.
Controversial Sourcing,"To this end, we seek to align with international best practices on due diligence set forth in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals From ConflictAffected and High-Risk Areas and comply with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires publicly traded U.S. companies to track, monitor and report annually on conflict minerals in supply chains. "
Controversial Sourcing,"Reflecting this philosophy, Micron is a founding member of the RMI, a consortium that works across the minerals industry to develop a common approach for addressing conflict mineral supply chains and protocols that may expand to include other minerals."
Controversial Sourcing,"The RMI includes a thirdparty auditing process, due diligence tools and a public database documenting where each smelter or refiner stands in its conflict-free journey."
Controversial Sourcing,"Micron is a member of the RMI's smelter engagement working group and has supported expansion of the RMI's cobalt reporting program, which we expect to be implemented in 2022."
Controversial Sourcing,"Because Micron does not produce batteries, we do not use significant amounts of cobalt."
Controversial Sourcing,"Even so, we have investigated potential cobalt use within our supply chain."
Controversial Sourcing,"Providing a complete, updated conflict minerals reporting template (CMRT) that discloses the source of conflict minerals that may be present in products sold to Micron, including the smelters from which the conflict minerals originated."
Controversial Sourcing,Updating CMRTs within two weeks of any smelter or refiner changes within the entire supply chain.
Controversial Sourcing,Adopting a conflict mineral policy dedicated to achieving a conflict-free supply chain.
Controversial Sourcing,"Participating in and facilitating audits of facilities, conflict mineral policies, conflict mineral procedures and associated records."
Controversial Sourcing,Directing their own suppliers to adopt conflict mineral policies.
Controversial Sourcing,"Micron implements policies and procedures to help ensure that our existing suppliers rely on smelters and refiners that are conflict-free, and we only engage with new suppliers that make similar commitments."
Controversial Sourcing,"We require suppliers to remove nonconformant smelters within 13 weeks when they fall out of approved status, but they often resolve issues sooner."
Controversial Sourcing,"Throughout 2020, all the smelters and refineries in Micron's supply chain conformed with responsible minerals sourcing standards."
Controversial Sourcing,We are committed to transparency and publish an annual conflict minerals report on our due diligence and progress toward a conflict-free supply chain.
Controversial Sourcing,"Like many companies in the electronics industry, ASML and our suppliers use minerals essential to the manufacturing process."
Controversial Sourcing,"The four main minerals concerned are tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, also known as 3TG."
Controversial Sourcing,We are committed to a conflict-free minerals policy and closely monitor the use of conflict minerals in our supply chain.
Controversial Sourcing,We support international efforts to ensure the mining of 3TG minerals from high-risk locations does not contribute to conditions of armed conflict or human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or any neighboring countries.
Controversial Sourcing,We also encourage our suppliers and sub-suppliers to have policies and due diligence measures in place to ensure the 3TG minerals we use are responsibly sourced.
Controversial Sourcing,"Our products contain various metals, including tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (3TG), originating from mines around the world."
Controversial Sourcing,"Some of this production comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries, where political instability and lack of security have allowed mines to be exploited by armed groups."
Controversial Sourcing,We support responsible sourcing from conflictaffected and high-risk areas.
Controversial Sourcing,"We avoid any activities that could be associated with financing armed conflict, and we engage extensively across our supply chain to seek solutions to this problem."
Controversial Sourcing,"Through our membership in the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), we support a range of industry tools and resources developed to address issues related to the responsible sourcing of minerals in the global supply chain, including the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP)."
Controversial Sourcing,RMI runs regular workshops on responsible minerals sourcing issues and contributes to policy development and debates with leading civil society organizations and governments.
Controversial Sourcing,We aim to confirm the presence of 3TG metals in products supplied to Motorola Solutions and to identify the smelters or refiners from which our suppliers source these metals.
Controversial Sourcing,We use the RMI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) to engage our direct material suppliers.
Controversial Sourcing,"We also support the RMI's Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) as part of our membership in the RMI, with the goal of promoting responsible mineral sourcing globally."
Controversial Sourcing,"In 2020 we communicated directly to smelters in our supply chain, in addition to tier-one suppliers, to encourage these smelters to either maintain their RMAP-conformant status in the RMI's program, or to encourage them to participate and become RMAPconformant if they are not already."
Controversial Sourcing,Our due diligence program is fully disclosed in our report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Controversial Sourcing,The 2020 report is available here.
Controversial Sourcing,"If those institutions utilize a competitor's equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines."
Controversial Sourcing,"Third parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claimsagainst us."
Controversial Sourcing,"From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent orother intellectual property rights.
"
Controversial Sourcing,"In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual propertyor other issues."
Controversial Sourcing,We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships.
Controversial Sourcing,"In addition, our bylaws and otherindemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they mayincur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us."
Controversial Sourcing,"From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify thirdparties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters.
"
Controversial Sourcing,"We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from abreach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe theintellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties."
Controversial Sourcing,"In such cases, it is our policyeither to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms.
"
Controversial Sourcing,"However, we may beunable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, orat all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financialresults, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties."
Controversial Sourcing,"Moreover, although we have insurance to protect usfrom certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or atall, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles."

Carbon Emissions,We offer customers world-class electrical product options to support their decarbonization efforts.
Carbon Emissions,"We innovate products that use nextgeneration, low-GWP refrigerants that enable our customers to transition away from high-GWP refrigerants and reduce their HFC emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we made significant improvements to our Clarksville, Tennessee, plant."
Carbon Emissions,"We previously tested customer equipment using refrigerant gases like R410A, but after a multi-year project at the facility, we switched to Nitrogen-Hydrogen and Helium mixes for testing; both 0 GWP gases."
Carbon Emissions,"The switch allowed our plant to avoid nearly 50,000 mtCO2 e annually — the annual emissions equivalent of over 10,800 passenger cars."
Carbon Emissions,"We upgraded light fixtures in addition to the refrigerant replacements, saving around 285,000 kWh per year in electricity consumption."
Carbon Emissions,"Finally, in 2021, we completed an Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) project and a cooling tower replacement."
Carbon Emissions,"The IAQ project enhanced indoor environmental air quality for our team members, and the new cooling tower resulted in a water use reduction of approximately 3 million gallons."

Carbon Emissions,Read more about carbon pricing in our CDP Climate response.
Carbon Emissions,"LS&Co. estimates one of the most comprehensive climate footprints in the apparel industry, including all Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories identified as relevant to LS&Co. operations (11 of 15)."
Carbon Emissions,"Of these, the biggest contributor to our footprint is our supply chain, referred to as Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1), and representing 60.4% of our footprint in 2020."
Carbon Emissions,"To make progress on these impacts and achieve our climate goals, we must collaborate with our suppliers."
Carbon Emissions,"That means working with them to set clear and ambitious targets, while also supporting their efforts to become more water and energy efficient and increasing their use of renewable electricity."
Carbon Emissions,This progress is on track to meet our 2025 science-based target of a 40% reduction.
Carbon Emissions,"However, several conditions associated with such an unprecedented year contributed to the reduction."
Carbon Emissions,"For instance, sourcing mix changes and sourcing base location changes played a role in reducing supply chain emissions, as did improvements to the electrical grid in some locations."
Carbon Emissions,"Our continued efforts to source more sustainable raw materials, such as more sustainable cotton and responsible manmade cellulosics, also played a role in reducing emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Fabric mills and garment manufacturers account for the majority of our full value chain carbon footprint, especially given that many of our fabric mills are also yarn spinners."
Carbon Emissions,We are working with our key suppliers — those representing approximately 80% of final product volume — in these two supply chain tiers to make sure their emission reduction targets are at least 40%.
Carbon Emissions,"To date, key suppliers have agreed to targets between 40% and 60%."
Carbon Emissions,"Achieving these goals will require not only facility changes to equipment, but also investment in renewable energy of multiple forms."
Carbon Emissions,Corporate commitments to net zero emissions have increased rapidly in recent years.
Carbon Emissions,"As of August 2021, almost one-third of the 1000+ largest listed European companies aim to reach net zero by 2050."
Carbon Emissions,"Achieving these targets is feasible, but it is a very high bar."
Carbon Emissions,"Just one in ten (9%) of the companies are on track, having cut their emissions in half over the past ten years."
Carbon Emissions,"Most companies will need to double the pace of emissions reduction in the next decade, and then accelerate further to achieve their net zero goal."
Carbon Emissions,It will take a step change in technology innovation and cross-industry collaboration to advance and deploy the technology and reduce GHG emissions to zero by 2050.
Carbon Emissions,"Global warming is having a devastating impact on the world around us, and European companies are bracing themselves for the challenge ahead."
Carbon Emissions,"Spurred on by the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, EU businesses across all sectors have intensified their efforts in cutting GHG emissions, and many have set emissions reduction targets."
Carbon Emissions,Action has rapidly accelerated in the past two years.
Carbon Emissions,"Governments of countries representing two-thirds of the global economy have also committed to reaching net zero before 2050, and many are adopting new policies and incentives, as well as increasing regulatory measures to push companies towards zero-carbon practices."
Carbon Emissions,"Government action is key, as conducive regulation can encourage and support emissions-reduction strategies among businesses."
Carbon Emissions,But investors often speak even louder.
Carbon Emissions,They are increasingly looking for companies to set a timeline and strategy for the transition.
Carbon Emissions,There are clear signs of progress.
Carbon Emissions,"9% of European companies have cut their own emissions in half in the past decade, according to Accenture research."
Carbon Emissions,"Plus, some of Europe's largest companies in carbon-intensive industries including mining, metals and minerals; petrochemicals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals; and utilities have boldly set out net zero plans."
Carbon Emissions,"As of August 2021, almost one-third of the 1,000+ largest listed European companies had set a target for reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest, covering all three scopes of emissions."
Carbon Emissions,Scope 1 emissions are GHG direct emissions from companies' own and controlled resources.
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy — i.e., purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company."
Carbon Emissions,Net zero typically refers to all three scopes.
Carbon Emissions,The companies making net zero commitments are responsible for more than two-thirds of the CO2 emitted by the 1000+ largest companies on the European stock exchanges.
Carbon Emissions,"They are generally the biggest emitters, with the most drastic changes to make."
Carbon Emissions,Targets work.
Carbon Emissions,"Last decade, companies in our sample with a net zero goal reduced their emissions by 10% on average, while those without targets saw their emissions increase."
Carbon Emissions,"There's more significant work to be done, however."
Carbon Emissions,"Just 1 in 20 European listed companies we surveyed will be able to achieve net zero in their own operations (Scope 1 and 2) at or before their own target year, and 9% by 2050 at the latest, if they continue the pace of emissions reduction that they have achieved between 2010 and 2019."
Carbon Emissions,"For most companies, the pathway to net zero operations by 2050 involves a doubling of the pace of emissions reduction by 2030, and a further acceleration beyond."
Carbon Emissions,"Simply put, European businesses must reimagine and reinvent the way they work - taking action to cut emissions in their own operations and collaborating across industry boundaries to decarbonize supply chains and product use."
Carbon Emissions,"42% of emissions of all companies that we analyzed are from five sectors: automotive; construction; manufacturing; oil, gas & chemicals; and transportation & storage."
Carbon Emissions,"Depending on the nature of their operations, some companies are simply more resource intensive and, consequently, larger carbon emitters."
Carbon Emissions,"For some, the majority of emissions occur in the supply chain, for others in the use of their product."
Carbon Emissions,"Some businesses are further ahead in their innovation journey, while others have only started recently."
Carbon Emissions,"Five sectors—automotive; construction; manufacturing; oil, gas & chemicals; and transportation & storage—accounting for 42% of emissions of all companies that we analyzed, will need to accelerate most to achieve net zero in their own operations by mid-century."
Carbon Emissions,"The more businesses that commit to net zero, the sooner large-scale emissions reduction can happen. And while companies have set different timeframes—the goal, on average, is 2043—there is broad consensus on the need to achieve net zero by 2050."
Carbon Emissions,The challenge is too immense for companies to do it alone.
Carbon Emissions,"Even with accelerated action—doubling the pace of emissions reduction by 2030 and then doubling it again by 2040 —just 42% of all of the companies in our sample and across sectors would reach their own net zero targets, and 83% before 2050."
Carbon Emissions,Large companies in particular have a major role to play in the collaborative ecosystems essential for the rapid application of net zero technologies and processes.
Carbon Emissions,Building bridges between industries to bring low-carbon solutions to maturity and scale: Steel producers and petrochemical companies working together to scale green hydrogen production for low-carbon steel manufacturing can help automotive companies accelerate the pace of emissions reduction.
Carbon Emissions,We've identified three key steps to help companies on their net zero journey:
Carbon Emissions,Commit to a science-based target.
Carbon Emissions,Research shows that targets do work.
Carbon Emissions,"Companies in our sample with net-zero targets reduced their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions between 2010 and 2019, while those without increased their emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Embed carbon intelligence into the very fabric of the company to better manage the company's carbon budget, by employing the same discipline used for financial budgets."
Carbon Emissions,Leverage influence to mobilize industry and value chain.
Carbon Emissions,It will take reinvention of business itself to ensure a commitment to the planet and create transformative change that will last for generations to come.
Carbon Emissions,"Microsoft President Brad Smith, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood and CEO Satya Nadella preparing to announce Microsoft's plan to be carbon negative by 2030."
Carbon Emissions,The scientific consensus is clear.
Carbon Emissions,The world confronts an urgent carbon problem.
Carbon Emissions,The carbon in our atmosphere has created a blanket of gas that traps heat and is changing the world's climate.
Carbon Emissions,"Already, the planet's temperature has risen by 1 degree centigrade."
Carbon Emissions,"As the scientific community has concluded, human activity has released more than 2 trillion metric tons of greenhouse gases into the Earth's atmosphere since the start of the First Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s."
Carbon Emissions,"Over three-quarters of this is carbon dioxide, with most of this carbon emitted since the mid-1950s."
Carbon Emissions,"This is more carbon than nature can re-absorb, and every year humanity pumps more than 50 billion metric tons of additional greenhouse gases into the air."
Carbon Emissions,This isn't a problem that lasts a few years or even a decade.
Carbon Emissions,Once excess carbon enters the atmosphere it can take thousands of years to dissipate.
Carbon Emissions,The world's climate experts agree that the world must take urgent action to bring down emissions.
Carbon Emissions,"Ultimately, we must reach ""net zero"" emissions, meaning that humanity must remove as much carbon as it emits each year."
Carbon Emissions,"This will take aggressive approaches, new technology that doesn't exist today, and innovative public policy."
Carbon Emissions,"It is an ambitious - even audacious - goal, but science tells us that it's a goal of fundamental importance to every person alive today and for every generation to follow."
Carbon Emissions,"While the world will need to reach net zero, those of us who can afford to move faster and go further should do so."
Carbon Emissions,That's why today we are announcing an ambitious goal and a new plan to reduce and ultimately remove Microsoft's carbon footprint.
Carbon Emissions,"By 2030 Microsoft will be carbon negative, and by 2050 Microsoft will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975."
Carbon Emissions,We recognize that progress requires not just a bold goal but a detailed plan.
Carbon Emissions,"As described below, we are launching today an aggressive program to cut our carbon emissions by more than half by 2030, both for our direct emissions and for our entire supply and value chain."
Carbon Emissions,"We will fund this in part by expanding our internal carbon fee, in place since 2012 and increased last year, to start charging not only our direct emissions, but those from our supply and value chains."
Carbon Emissions,"We are also launching an initiative to use Microsoft technology to help our suppliers and customers around the world reduce their own carbon footprints and a new $1 billion climate innovation fund to accelerate the global development of carbon reduction, capture, and removal technologies."
Carbon Emissions,"Beginning next year, we will also make carbon reduction an explicit aspect of our procurement processes for our supply chain."
Carbon Emissions,Our progress on all of these fronts will be published in a new annual Environmental Sustainability Report that will detail our carbon impact and reduction journey.
Carbon Emissions,"And lastly, all this work will be supported by our voice and advocacy supporting public policy that will accelerate carbon reduction and removal opportunities."
Carbon Emissions,"Whenever we take on a new and complex societal issue, we strive first to learn and then to define a principled approach to guide our efforts."
Carbon Emissions,"This has been fundamental to our work around the protection of privacy and the ethical development of artificial intelligence, and it's the approach we're taking to pursue our aggressive carbon goals as well."
Carbon Emissions,"We've concluded that seven principles, or elements, will be vital as we continually innovate and take additional steps on an ongoing basis."
Carbon Emissions,Grounding in science and math.
Carbon Emissions,"We will continually ground our work in the best available science and most accurate math, as we describe further below."
Carbon Emissions,Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint.
Carbon Emissions,"We will take responsibility for all our emissions, so by 2030 we can cut them by more than half and remove more carbon than we emit each year."
Carbon Emissions,Investing for new carbon reduction and removal technology.
Carbon Emissions,We will deploy $1 billion of our own capital in a new Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate the development of carbon reduction and removal technologies that will help us and the world become carbon negative.
Carbon Emissions,Empowering customers around the world.
Carbon Emissions,"Perhaps most importantly, we will develop and deploy digital technology to help our suppliers and customers reduce their carbon footprints."
Carbon Emissions,Ensuring effective transparency.
Carbon Emissions,"We will publish an annual Environmental Sustainability Report that provides transparency on our progress, based on strong global reporting standards."
Carbon Emissions,Using our voice on carbon-related public policy issues.
Carbon Emissions,We will support new public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon reduction and removal opportunities.
Carbon Emissions,Enlisting our employees.
Carbon Emissions,"We recognize that our employees will be our biggest asset in advancing innovation, and we will create new opportunities to enable them to contribute to our efforts."
Carbon Emissions,It's vital that our work as a company to address carbon issues stay grounded in ongoing scientific advances and an accurate reliance on the basic but fundamental mathematical concepts involved.
Carbon Emissions,And this is true for all of us as individual consumers and the business community more broadly.
Carbon Emissions,"In some respects, the situation is straightforward."
Carbon Emissions,"As shown in the graph below, advances in human prosperity, as measured by GDP growth, are inextricably tied to the use of energy."
Carbon Emissions,This is true for the future as well as the past.
Carbon Emissions,"If we're going to continue to create more economic opportunity and prosperity, it likely will require even more energy use."
Carbon Emissions,"This is true everywhere in the world, and it's perhaps especially true among the world's developing economies, which deserve the opportunity to catch up with the level of prosperity in more industrialized nations."
Carbon Emissions,"For more than two centuries and especially since the 1950s, economic development has required an ever-increasing amount of carbon emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Indeed, if we fail to change substantially and quickly, there is a high risk that average temperatures will increase between another one and four degrees Celsius by the end of this century."
Carbon Emissions,And the impact of such a temperature increase would be catastrophic.
Carbon Emissions,A big part of the challenge is that as a society we have not committed sufficiently to reduce emissions.
Carbon Emissions,"One conclusion we've reached is that we all need to learn - and get real - about ""carbon math."
Carbon Emissions,"This is the basic mathematical concepts that are important to understanding how the carbon issue applies to each of us, whether as individuals, families, businesses, or other organizations."
Carbon Emissions,One aspect of this is relatively simple but quite important.
Carbon Emissions,"Scientists account for carbon emissions by classifying them into three categories, or ""scopes."
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions that your activities create — like the exhaust from the car you drive, or for a business, the trucks it drives to transport its products from one place to another or the generators it might run."
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come from the production of the electricity or heat you use, like the traditional energy sources that light up your home or power the buildings owned by a business."
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 3 emissions are the indirect emissions that come from all the other activities in which you're engaged, including the emissions associated with producing the food you eat, or manufacturing the products that you buy."
Carbon Emissions,"For a business, these emission sources can be extensive, and must be accounted for across its entire supply chain, the materials in its buildings, the business travel of its employees, and the full life cycle of its products, including the electricity customers may consume when using the product."
Carbon Emissions,"Given this broad range, a company's scope 3 emissions are often far larger than its scope 1 and 2 emissions put together."
Carbon Emissions,This makes clear that we need to measure all three of these scopes.
Carbon Emissions,"At Microsoft, we expect to emit 16 million metric tons of carbon this year."
Carbon Emissions,"Of this total, about 100,000 are scope 1 emissions and about 4 million are scope 2 emissions."
Carbon Emissions,The remaining 12 million tons all fall into scope 3.
Carbon Emissions,"Given the wide range of scope 3 activities, this higher percentage of the total is probably typical for most organizations."
Carbon Emissions,There's another aspect of carbon math that's also essential.
Carbon Emissions,"This is the difference between being ""carbon neutral"" and being ""net zero."
Carbon Emissions,"While they sound similar, in fact they're different."
Carbon Emissions,"Given common usage, companies have typically said they're ""carbon neutral"" if they offset their emissions with payments either to avoid a reduction in emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere."
Carbon Emissions,But these are two very different things.
Carbon Emissions,"For example, one way to avoid a reduction in emissions is to pay someone not to cut down the trees on the land they own."
Carbon Emissions,"This is a good thing, but in effect it pays someone not to do something that would have a negative impact."
Carbon Emissions,It doesn't lead to planting more trees that would have a positive impact by removing carbon.
Carbon Emissions,"In contrast, ""net zero"" means that a company actually removes as much carbon as it emits."
Carbon Emissions,"The reason the phrase is ""net zero"" and not just ""zero"" is because there are still carbon emissions, but these are equal to carbon removal."
Carbon Emissions,"And ""carbon negative"" means that a company is removing more carbon than it emits each year."
Carbon Emissions,"Like most carbon-neutral companies, Microsoft has achieved carbon neutrality primarily by investing in offsets that primarily avoid emissions instead of removing carbon that has already been emitted."
Carbon Emissions,"While it is imperative that we continue to avoid emissions, and these investments remain important, we see an acute need to begin removing carbon from the atmosphere, which we believe we can help catalyze through our investments."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, we've identified another shortcoming that we and many other companies need to overcome."
Carbon Emissions,That's why we're committing to becoming carbon negative for 2030 for all three scopes.
Carbon Emissions,"Based on this science and math, we're launching today an aggressive plan to reduce Microsoft's own carbon emissions."
Carbon Emissions,It has three broad components.
Carbon Emissions,"First, we will drive down our scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by the middle of this decade through the following steps:"
Carbon Emissions,"By 2025, we will shift to 100 percent supply of renewable energy, meaning that we will have power purchase agreements for green energy contracted for 100 percent of carbon emitting electricity consumed by all our data centers, buildings, and campuses."
Carbon Emissions,We will electrify our global campus operations vehicle fleet by 2030.
Carbon Emissions,We will pursue International Living Future Institute Zero Carbon certification and LEED Platinum certification for our Silicon Valley Campus and Puget Sound Campus Modernization projects.
Carbon Emissions,"Second, we will reduce our scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030 through new steps, including the following:"
Carbon Emissions,"Currently this fee is $15/metric ton and covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions, plus scope 3 travel emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Unlike some other companies, our internal carbon tax isn't a ""shadow fee"" that is calculated but not charged."
Carbon Emissions,"Our fee is paid by each division in our business based on its carbon emissions, and the funds are used to pay for sustainability improvements."
Carbon Emissions,This will both increase incentives across the company to reduce all scope 3 emissions and fund the added work to reduce our own scope 3 emissions and invest in carbon removal activities.
Carbon Emissions,"By July of 2021, we will begin to implement new procurement processes and tools to enable and incentivize our suppliers to reduce their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions."
Carbon Emissions,We will work with our suppliers to implement consistent and accurate reporting and pursue effective steps to make progress against scientifically based targets.
Carbon Emissions,"Third, by 2030 Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits, setting us on a path to remove by 2050 all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975."
Carbon Emissions,"We will achieve this through a portfolio of negative emission technologies (NET) potentially including afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs), and direct air capture (DAC)."
Carbon Emissions,Microsoft will form its carbon removal portfolio annually by assessing NET attributes pertaining to four criteria: (1) scalability; (2) affordability; (3) commercial availability and (4) verifiability.
Carbon Emissions,"Given the current state of technology and pricing, we will initially focus on nature-based solutions, with the goal of shifting to technology-based solutions between now and 2050, when they become more viable."
Carbon Emissions,Solving our planet's carbon issues will require technology that does not exist today. That's why a significant part of our endeavor involves putting Microsoft's balance sheet to work to stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology.
Carbon Emissions,Our new Climate Innovation Fund will commit to invest $1 billion over the next four years into new technologies and expand access to capital around the world to people working to solve this problem.
Carbon Emissions,"We understand that this is just a fraction of the investment needed, but our hope is that it spurs more governments and companies to invest in new ways as well."
Carbon Emissions,We will primarily deploy this capital in two areas: (1) to accelerate ongoing technology development by investing in project and debt finance; and (2) to invest in new innovations through equity and debt capital.
Carbon Emissions,"We'll focus our funding on investments primarily based on four criteria: (1) strategies that have the prospect of driving meaningful decarbonization, climate resilience, or other sustainability impact; (2) additional market impact in accelerating current and potential solutions; (3) relevance to Microsoft by creating technologies we can use to address our unpaid climate debt and future emissions; and (4) consideration of climate equity, including for developing economies."
Carbon Emissions,"We believe that Microsoft's most important contribution to carbon reduction will come not from our own work alone but by helping our customers around the world reduce their carbon footprints through our learnings and with the power of data science, artificial intelligence, and digital technology."
Carbon Emissions,"For many customers, sustainability is already a core part of their business, while others are just beginning their work to mitigate their carbon impact."
Carbon Emissions,"Regardless of where organizations are on their journey, we're committed to being of help."
Carbon Emissions,Better tracking of carbon starts by creating greater transparency on the carbon impact of services and products.
Carbon Emissions,"Today we're launching a new tool, the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator that analyzes the estimated emissions from Azure services through a Power BI dashboard."
Carbon Emissions,"This helps customers better understand the carbon impact of their cloud workloads, discover the potential benefits from fully migrating to Azure, and assists them in reporting their carbon footprint for IT services for the often hard-to-track Scope 3 emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"We will follow this with new solutions and offerings that go further, including providing insight across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 and material circularity related to all Microsoft Azure services."
Carbon Emissions,"We will also provide greater transparency on the carbon performance of Teams, Edge and other services and solutions."
Carbon Emissions,This work builds on a foundation of science-based methodologies and transparency on environmental performance of our cloud infrastructure and supply chain.
Carbon Emissions,We are also launching a new 24/7 matching solution with Vattenfall - a first-of-its-kind approach that gives customers the ability to choose the green energy they want and ensure their consumption matches that goal using Azure IoT.
Carbon Emissions,"This new level of transparency can enable users to adjust their business operations to better fit the availability of the green energy they prefer, further decreasing their carbon footprint."
Carbon Emissions,"This will include co-innovating with customers and partners to develop low-carbon solutions, as we've done with L&T Technology Services, ABB, and Johnson Controls on sustainable smart building solutions capable of reducing energy consumption by 40 percent; embedding sustainability into our strategic alliances as we've pioneered with AT&T and NTT; driving cross-industry collaborations and coalitions to develop new standards and tools."
Carbon Emissions,The significance and complexity of the task ahead is incredible and will require contributions from every person and organization on the planet.
Carbon Emissions,"That's why we are committed to continuing to work with all our customers, including those in the oil and gas business, to help them meet today's business demands while innovating together to achieve the business needs of a net zero carbon future."
Carbon Emissions,"Continued improvement in standards of living around the world will require more energy, not less."
Carbon Emissions,"It's imperative that we enable energy companies to transition, including to renewable energy and to the development and use of negative emission technologies like carbon capture and storage and direct air capture."
Carbon Emissions,All this must be paired together to achieve the growing energy needs of an expanding global economy.
Carbon Emissions,"When it comes to carbon reduction, real progress requires real transparency."
Carbon Emissions,"As we're doing today, Microsoft will continue to disclose the carbon footprint of our services and solutions."
Carbon Emissions,"We will support strong industry-wide standards for transparency and reporting on carbon emissions and removal, and we will apply these ourselves."
Carbon Emissions,"Today we are also signing the United Nations' 1.5-degree Business Ambition Pledge, and we hope many other companies will also join."
Carbon Emissions,We will publicly track our progress in our annual Environmental Sustainability Report.
Carbon Emissions,We will also use our voice to speak out on four public policy issues that we think can advance all of the world's carbon efforts:
Carbon Emissions,"The need to expand global basic and applied research efforts on carbon, funded by governments, and reorient them towards targeted outcomes and enhanced cross-border collaboration to develop the breakthrough technologies needed to achieve net zero global emissions."
Carbon Emissions,The removal of regulatory barriers to help catalyze markets to enable carbon-reduction technologies to scale more quickly.
Carbon Emissions,The use of market and pricing mechanisms so people and businesses can make more informed carbon decisions.
Carbon Emissions,The empowerment of consumers through transparency based on universal standards to inform purchasers about the carbon content of goods and services.
Carbon Emissions,"As we've found with Microsoft's accessibility efforts, we believe that sustainability is a cause that is not only important to our employees, but an area where they can generate important insights and innovations across the company."
Carbon Emissions,"We will create more opportunities for our employees to become actively involved, both in company-wide activities and in the work of their individual teams. We're launching today an expanded internal site where our employees can learn more."
Carbon Emissions,Each year this work will culminate during our annual weeklong hackathon event that will include a specific focus and call for proposals on carbon reduction and removal.
Carbon Emissions,"Reducing carbon is where the world needs to go, and we recognize that it's what our customers and employees are asking us to pursue."
Carbon Emissions,This is a bold bet — a moonshot — for Microsoft.
Carbon Emissions,And it will need to become a moonshot for the world.
Carbon Emissions,It won't be easy for Microsoft to become carbon negative by 2030. But we believe it's the right goal.
Carbon Emissions,"We will need to continue to learn and adapt, both separately and even more importantly in close collaboration with others around the world."
Carbon Emissions,"We believe we launch this new initiative today with a well-developed plan and a clear line of sight, but we have problems to solve and technologies that need to be invented."
Carbon Emissions,It's time to get to work.
Carbon Emissions,Climate change is the most pressing environmental challenge of our time.
Carbon Emissions,"Matson has established the following short-, medium- and long-term goals that reflect our commitment and contribution to helping the world decarbonize and limit climate change:"
Carbon Emissions,"In working to meet our 2030 climate goal, we are evaluating and planning to pursue many different approaches to increasing efficiency, which may include:"
Carbon Emissions,Deploying new engine monitoring technology to help increase fuel efficiency.
Carbon Emissions,Adopting technology upgrades to our vessel weather routing services to help reduce fuel consumption.
Carbon Emissions,"Reducing vessel speed, where possible, throughout our network."
Carbon Emissions,"Converting Manukai and the new Aloha and Kanaloa class vessels to operate on LNG and conventional fuels, and installing tanks that are able to accommodate future carbon-neutral fuels when commercially available."
Carbon Emissions,"Designing new vessels to be energy efficient, with features such as shaft generators and improved bulbous bow, hull, rudder, and propeller designs."
Carbon Emissions,"Using onshore electricity, when available, to power vessels when in port."
Carbon Emissions,Implementing more environmentally sensitive container design practices and refrigerants.
Carbon Emissions,Installing additional energy saving devices on vessels such as onboard LED lighting.
Carbon Emissions,"Matson was an early adopter of ""cold ironing,"" which refers to the use of shoreside electrical power in port rather than burning diesel to keep our vessel engines running."
Carbon Emissions,"We made modifications to our vessels serving ports in California and China to equip them to provide cold ironing, a move that is helping to reduce fuel and ultimately emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Nine of 12 active vessels in our domestic fleet have exhaust gas cleaning systems, or ""scrubbers,"" that virtually eliminate particulate matter and sulfur from engine exhaust."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, our four newest vessels are equipped with dual fuel capable engines which can run at full power on low-sulfur fuel or liquefied natural gas."
Carbon Emissions,"Our newest Kanaloa Class vessels have Tier III engines, which are designed to meet the strictest International Maritime Organization (IMO) NOx emissions standards."
Carbon Emissions,All of our vessels meet or exceed the dramatically reduced fuel tolerances of the IMO 2020 regulations.
Carbon Emissions,The world is calling for nations and businesses to work together to address global climate change.
Carbon Emissions,"Human-induced climate change has wrought observable impacts to people, infrastructure and ecosystems, including increases in global temperatures, more frequent heatwaves, extreme precipitation in some regions and droughts in others."
Carbon Emissions,We are committed to doing our part in the global response to the threat of climate change and to advance sustainable development.
Carbon Emissions,"In support of our mission to improve the quality of life and environment, we are part of the global movement to limit the increase of the world's temperature to 1.5°C by committing to science-based targets."
Carbon Emissions,"A science-based target is an objective, scientific evaluation of what is needed for global greenhouse gas emissions reduction to limit catastrophic climate change."
Carbon Emissions,"These targets include cutting carbon emissions from our operations by at least 50 percent by 2030, positioning us to achieve carbon neutrality at the same time."
Carbon Emissions,We will also reduce indirect emissions generated through our value chain by 15 percent.
Carbon Emissions,"Implement energy-efficient solutions in our operations, optimizing renewable energy generation and purchases, greening our energy contracts and purchasing carbon offsets where necessary."
Carbon Emissions,Establish a chartered executive sustainability council chaired by our CEO to provide oversight and enhance accountability and alignment on our sustainability strategy.
Carbon Emissions,Invest more than $3 billion in research and development over the next 10 years targeted at creating sustainable solutions for our customers that reduce our value chain emissions.
Carbon Emissions,Continue to reduce our operational footprint by accelerating our zero waste-to-landfill initiative and replicating our successful waste reduction approach for our new water target.
Carbon Emissions,"Since 2018, we have reduced the total amount of GHG emitted by our operations by 198,487 metric tons CO2e, which is an 18% decrease and places us on track to meet our target."
Carbon Emissions,"By 2030 we are committed to achieving a science-based target of 50% reduction (from a 2018 baseline) of our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, in line with a 1.5 degree Celsius climate scenario."
Carbon Emissions,Our most recently publicly available data are provided in the table below.
Carbon Emissions,Eaton uses an independent verification body to verify our GHG data.
Carbon Emissions,"The verification includes a ""reasonable"" level of assurance for Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company) and Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from goods or resources with potential GHG emissions, mostly from the purchase of electricity)."
Carbon Emissions,"The Scope 3 verification includes a ""limited"" level of assurance for emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)."
Carbon Emissions,"Harold Jones, executive vice president, Eaton Business System and Sustainability, describes how we're working toward a healthier planet with our customers."
Carbon Emissions,Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and others emphasize the importance of conducting and disclosing low-carbon transition plans.
Carbon Emissions,"So in 2021, we developed our 2030 ScienceBased Target transition strategy."
Carbon Emissions,The following chart illustrates our current planned path to our 2030 targets and the decarbonization levers that will get us there.
Carbon Emissions,The left axis shows the emissions-driving activities of the baseline footprint in 2019.
Carbon Emissions,"By way of example, the chart highlights that 35% of our 2019 baseline carbon footprint is from electricity - to achieve our 2030 targets we expect to reduce emissions from electricity by 24% relative to our forecasted business-as-usual footprint via renewable resources."
Carbon Emissions,"Fossil fuels touch every part of our physical operations, so there are a range of ""decarbonization levers"" we will pull to meet our emission reduction goals."
Carbon Emissions,These range from energy efficiency to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
Carbon Emissions,"Our two main sources of internal emissions are (1) the fuel we burn, and (2) electricity we consume."
Carbon Emissions,"This includes using fossil-fuel generated electricity and the direct combustion of fossil fuels for heating buildings, creating mobile electricity supply (e.g. diesel generators for film sets), and in transportation: vehicles & planes."
Carbon Emissions,"Co-op students' work includes experience related to project work, strategy, analysis, programming, and finance."
Carbon Emissions,In 2020/21 the number of paid internships was greatly reduced because of the impacts of the pandemic on the workplace.
Carbon Emissions,A total of 18 students participating in the Co-operative Education program were hired in either a four-month or eight-month work term to complement their studies.
Carbon Emissions,Participating post-secondary schools for the Spring/Summer Co-operative internship term included
Carbon Emissions,A world that runs entirely on green energy starts with ourselves.
Carbon Emissions,We work every day to decarbonise our energy generation and operations (scope 1-2) and to achieve net-zero emissions in our full value chain (scope 1-3) by 2040.
Carbon Emissions,"Emissions primarily2 come from manufacturing and transporting renewable energy components, and secondarily from mining and transporting coal, which we will phase out completely at the end of Q1 2023."
Carbon Emissions,The main emission source is the fuel for the vessels used by our contractors to install offshore wind farms
Carbon Emissions,Emissions mainly come from burning coal at combined heat and power plants. We will phase out the use of coal at the end of Q1 2023.
Carbon Emissions,Emissions mainly come from fuel used for the vessels we charter during the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms.
Carbon Emissions,"Some emissions, e.g. from company cars, result directly from our daily business administration (scope 1)."
Carbon Emissions,"The majority are indirectly linked to our activities, such as the emissions from the production of the energy we buy for our own consumption (scope 2), and the goods and services we buy (scope 3)."
Carbon Emissions,Emissions mainly come from wholesale buying and selling of natural gas.
Carbon Emissions,"Since 73 % of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the production and use of fossil fuel-based energy, decarbonising energy generation and improving energy efficiency are the most important actions for limiting climate change."
Carbon Emissions,We have set a science-based target of reducing the emissions intensity in our energy generation and operations with at least 98 % from 2006 to become a carbon-neutral company in 2025.
Carbon Emissions,"This covers emissions from generation of heat and power and our operations, including the vessels servicing our wind farms, our vehicles, and our sites (scope 1 and 2)."
Carbon Emissions,We have reduced the GHG intensity of our energy generation and operations by 87 % since 2006 to 58 g CO 2e/kWh in 2021.
Carbon Emissions,We are on track to reach our target of at least a 98 % reduction by 2025.
Carbon Emissions,"We no longer buy or lease fossil-fuelled cars, and by 2025, our entire vehicle fleet, including site and operational vehicles, will be fully electric."
Carbon Emissions,"Currently, we have a 41 % share of electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrids) in our fleet."
Carbon Emissions,"We cover 100 % of our own power consumption with green certificates, mainly from our offshore wind farms."
Carbon Emissions,"We are maturing our portfolio of carbon removal projects to ensure that we offset any residual emissions through certified, high-quality nature-based solutions and reach our 2025 carbon-neutral target (scope 1-2). In 2021, we agreed with the Gambian government and local NGOs to develop a mangrove conservation and reforestation project."
Carbon Emissions,"Continue to drive out emissions across scope 1-2, beyond our 98 % reduction target."
Carbon Emissions,"Joined RE100, a global initiative of influential businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity"
Carbon Emissions,"Reaching net zero GHG emissions across our underwriting and investments portfolios by 2050, or sooner"
Carbon Emissions,"Reaffirming last year's operational net zero commitment by 2050, or sooner"
Carbon Emissions,"Sourcing 100 percent Renewable Energy for AIG's operations by 2030, or sooner"
Carbon Emissions,"Using science-based emissions reduction targets, aligning with the latest climate science to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement"
Carbon Emissions,"Leading change in a changing world requires being a company of action— and, as a market leader, AIG is committed to setting the standard with our actions."
Carbon Emissions,"We believe our ESG commitments are an important step forward for AIG, the clients we serve and the global communities where we live and work."
Carbon Emissions,"Prior to establishing net zero commitments, AIG wanted to ascertain its carbon exposure baseline."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we completed a carbon exposure assessment of our General Insurance underwriting and investment portfolios to understand our current state and guide our climate strategy, including our recent net zero commitments."
Carbon Emissions,"To conduct this analysis, we used the latest climate data science, standards and frameworks available."
Carbon Emissions,Graph 2 at right shows AIG's estimated emissions.
Carbon Emissions,This is based on data availability and existing methodologies.
Carbon Emissions,"As the standards and frameworks continue to evolve and more complete data becomes available, the estimations may change."
Carbon Emissions,This analysis does not include Life & Retirement's underwriting or investment portfolios given the expected separation of this business from AIG.
Carbon Emissions,"The emissions of companies that AIG underwrites and invests in make up most of our estimated emissions, while AIG's own operations represent approximately 1% of the total."
Carbon Emissions,AIG intends to reduce its emissions by setting and pursuing science-based targets.
Carbon Emissions,Remaining emissions that cannot be reduced will be neutralized with highquality offsets.
Carbon Emissions,AIG collects data on GHG emissions using an organizational boundary based on activities within our operational control.
Carbon Emissions,"Where available, GHG emissions are calculated on the basis of actual (i.e., metered) data received."
Carbon Emissions,"In certain instances where actual data is not available, GHG emissions are estimated using internationally accepted and recognized methodologies from The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard from the World Resource Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development."
Carbon Emissions,"Since 2019, we have collected information from certain sources of emissions that are controlled or owned by AIG (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) and from value chain activities not directly owned or controlled by AIG (scope 3 emissions)."
Carbon Emissions,These include the following:
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 1 emissions: sources from fuel combustion at facilities (e.g., boilers, heating, back-up generators) and from mobile sources (e.g., corporate air and ground fleet)"
Carbon Emissions,Scope 2 emissions: sources from the purchase of electricity
Carbon Emissions,Scope 3 emissions: sources from business air travel
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, with the support of a third-party consultant, we were able to expand our collection of GHG emissions data and capture additional sources of emissions we were unable to measure and report in prior years (2019 and 2020)."
Carbon Emissions,These additional sources include:
Carbon Emissions,Scope 1 emissions: sources from refrigerants
Carbon Emissions,Scope 2 emissions: sources from district heating
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 3 emissions: sources associated with purchased goods and services1 , fuel- and energy-related activities not already included in scope 1 or 2 (e.g., transmission and distribution losses from the generation of electricity, steam, heating and cooling) and waste generated in operations and upstream leased assets"
Carbon Emissions,"To meet our net zero commitments, we will need to engage with our clients, suppliers and investees and other stakeholders to understand our decarbonization pathways, collaborate and partner to find and develop solutions."
Carbon Emissions,"As we expected, our estimated emissions across the two scopes increased from 2020 to 2021 as the effect of COVID-19 lessened."
Carbon Emissions,"Nonetheless, total scope 1 and 2 estimated emissions for 2021 remained below pre-pandemic levels."
Carbon Emissions,This is in part due to the consolidation of Real Estate spaces.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, AIG consolidated its New York-area office spaces from seven properties to three locations: Downtown New York City, Midtown New York City and Jersey City, New Jersey."
Carbon Emissions,The increase in scope 1 emissions is primarily due to improvements in data coverage and estimation methodologies applied for unknown data.
Carbon Emissions,Accelerate productivity and carbon efficiency of customers' digital operations.
Carbon Emissions,Achieve net zero carbon emissions for our operations and supply chain.
Carbon Emissions,Aligning Our Climate Commitment to ScienceBased Targets
Carbon Emissions,VMware's net zero emissions goal builds on approved science-based targets and expands the scope of our climate commitment.
Carbon Emissions,Our strategy is designed to enable VMware and our people to take action even as the definition of a net zero future evolves.
Carbon Emissions,A changing target doesn't stop continued innovation on climate action.
Carbon Emissions,"For us, a net zero goal means accelerating our focus on reducing emissions for our entire carbon footprint."
Carbon Emissions,"Among other things, we purchase renewable energy, work with our suppliers to reduce their emissions, and support distributed workforces through our Future of Work initiative to reduce what we can."
Carbon Emissions,"Through carbon financing, we participate in low carbon sustainable development projects that enable carbon avoidance to offset our remaining emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"In line with the leading net zero guidance, we are developing our strategy to include carbon removal projects to address residual emissions."
Carbon Emissions,Our science-based targets lay the foundation for reducing our footprint.
Carbon Emissions,"In early 2020, these targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
Carbon Emissions,"These are ambitious 1.5 ̊C-aligned targets, currently the highest designation available through the SBTi process:"
Carbon Emissions,Reduce employee commute and fuel and energy related emissions 50 percent by 2030
Carbon Emissions,Engage 75 percent of our suppliers to set their own Science-Based Targets by 2024
Carbon Emissions,Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity.
Carbon Emissions,"Its effects are already evident with more erratic weather patterns, more severe weather events and greater environmental degradation."
Carbon Emissions,"At our sites and with our suppliers, we are working toward reducing or preventing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our activities."
Carbon Emissions,"In our Good Growth Plan, we commit to strive for carbon-neutral agriculture."
Carbon Emissions,This includes a bold commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of our entire operations by at least 50% by 2030 compared to our 2016 baseline.
Carbon Emissions,"At the same time and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), we have a target to reduce the carbon intensity of our entire operations by 68% based on value added by 2030 compared to our 2016 baseline."
Carbon Emissions,"To achieve our 2030 carbon intensity reduction target, we are focusing on improving the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, designing and implementing site-based energy-saving programs, increasing the share of renewable sources of energy, and partnering with our crop protection and seed suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, we are working to further optimize our business travel and logistics network."
Carbon Emissions,"More information about how we manage climate-related issues, including governance, strategy, risks and opportunities, and detailed performance information, can be found in our CDP Climate Change submission 2021 in which Syngenta was scored A-."
Carbon Emissions,Our work to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is described on page 89.
Carbon Emissions,"To measure progress toward our SBTi and Good Growth Plan commitments, we report carbon intensity based on value added (defined as gross profit) as well as performance indicators for scope 1 (i.e., direct emissions from owned or controlled sources), scope 2 (i.e., indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy), and scope 3 (i.e., indirect emissions that occur in the value chain)."
Carbon Emissions,We also report carbon intensity based on sales for comparison purposes and in alignment with the environmental performance indicators presented in other Sustainable Operations disclosures in this report.
Carbon Emissions,The performance of our sites is based on data collected through internal reporting processes.
Carbon Emissions,The emissions are calculated based on the reported quantity and relevant emission factors within our central internal environmental data reporting system (SERAM).
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 2 emissions are reported using market-based and, when not available, location-based emission factors."
Carbon Emissions,"The performance of our supply chain is estimated using a hybrid approach of spend-based and average data methods, depending on the type of process or material described."
Carbon Emissions,"Where the quantity of material is relevant and measured in standardized (metric or imperial) units, the quantity-based emission factors and the average data method are used."
Carbon Emissions,"Where quantity is not a relevant metric (such as hours of consulting or engineering work) or standardized (such as number of pieces of packaging, or number of boxes of labels), the spend-based method is used."
Carbon Emissions,"To further improve the calculation method, in 2021 a small number of supplier emission factors were used instead of database emission factors, where suppliers had calculated their actual product carbon footprints."
Carbon Emissions,KPIs measuring progress toward our SBTi-approved carbon reduction target are labeled as SBTi.
Carbon Emissions,Lloyd's has tracked and disclosed its own emissions for a number of years.
Carbon Emissions,"In that time, we have seen strong progress with our overall carbon footprint falling by 57% since the 2013 baseline."
Carbon Emissions,Our international offices have reduced their emissions by 54% since the 2013 baseline.
Carbon Emissions,"Following the drastic fall in emissions seen in 2020, when the Lloyd's building and international borders were closed due to COVID-19, our emissions saw a small uptick in 2021 of 0.8% (on the previous year) following the resumption of activity in our London and global offices."
Carbon Emissions,"While we were disappointed by the increase on the previous year, the fall in emissions per employee of 12.5% - from 5.6 tCO2e/FTE in 2020, to 4.9 tCO2e/ FTE - indicated that our underlying emissions are continuing to fall."
Carbon Emissions,"As the vast majority of Corporation emissions (91%) are generated in the UK, we are therefore targeting much of our energy and carbon reduction activities on our London headquarters. We are working to see a reduction in emissions, across all measures, in 2022, and to achieve this, we will focus on:"
Carbon Emissions,"Implementing our carbon management plan which was developed in 2021, while continuing to manage our carbon performance through the environmental management system ISO14001"
Carbon Emissions,Zero emissions by 2050 (In 2022 we are committing to Science Based Targets).
Carbon Emissions,Carbon neutral Scope 1 operations by 2040.
Carbon Emissions,First zero emission ship sailing on the Norwegian coast by 2030.
Carbon Emissions,Working systematically towards emissions- free operations in 2050 is a dual process.
Carbon Emissions,"For us, this means being emission-free by 2050, with aggressive emissions reductions over the next 28 years in accordance with the SBTi framework."
Carbon Emissions,"We also want to further push our organisation towards a greener and more sustainable future, and target carbon neutral Scope 1 operations by 2040."
Carbon Emissions,"For us, being carbon neutral means having a neutral impact on the environment by removing the same amount of CO2 that we put into the atmosphere."
Carbon Emissions,The most important step to reach this is to ensure we can operate our vessels with as few emissions as possible.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021 we saw a significant decrease in emissions, with an absolute reduction of our Scope 1 emissions of more than a hundred thousand tonnes of CO2."
Carbon Emissions,"We are also working towards measuring our Scope 3 emissions to include activities from our supply chain, business travel and the transportation of guests to our ships (for example, air travel from home to port) into our climate accounting."
Carbon Emissions,Our environmental footprint has been a focus for Hurtigruten Group for decades.
Carbon Emissions,"The target is to be emission-free, and all parts of our operations are included in initiatives to help us reach that goal."
Carbon Emissions,"There are numerous examples of how we are working to lower emissions, and how we take pride in having the greenest vessels in the industry."
Carbon Emissions,Back in 2009 we banned the use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) in all our operations.
Carbon Emissions,"Furthermore, we work with NGOs to promote a broader international HFO ban for all vessels sailing in the Arctic."
Carbon Emissions,"HFO has severe negative environmental impacts, but it still makes up about 75% of the marine fuel currently consumed in the Arctic today."
Carbon Emissions,"Since banning HFO, Hurtigruten Group has shifted its focus towards synthetic fuels and will gradually increase the use of certified biofuels across the fleet."
Carbon Emissions,The use of shore power can eliminate approximately 150 tonnes of CO2 and 2.5 tonnes of NOx per vessel each year.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2016 we ordered our first battery-powered hybrid electric cruise vessels, and in 2020 we proudly launched the ships MS Roald Amundsen and MS Fridtjof Nansen as the world's first battery hybrids."
Carbon Emissions,"MS Fridtjof Nansen, with its state-of-the-art technology and premium onboard experience, was named ""The safest and most sustainable cruise ship in the world"" by STERN in 2021."
Carbon Emissions,You can find more information and learn more about why our ship was given this accolade in the section about Hurtigruten Expeditions under Our Business.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2019 we introduced battery-powered snowmobiles in our land-based adventure travel company, Hurtigruten Svalbard."
Carbon Emissions,"Together with the Finnish start-up Auroa Powertrains, this was the industry first for snowmobiles, starting a new era of silent and emission-free exploration with the aim of cutting our Scope 1 emissions in Svalbard."
Carbon Emissions,In 2021 we introduced our third battery hybrid-powered ship after the upgrade of MS Otto Sverdrup.
Carbon Emissions,"Also in 2021, we announced one of the largest environmental upgrades in the history of European shipping, as all seven Hurtigruten Norwegian Coastal Express ships will be undergoing significant green upgrades by 2023."
Carbon Emissions,"The ships will be installed with a combination of technologies and solutions specially adapted for each, allowing a significant reduction of CO2 and NOx emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Three of the ships - MS Richard With, MS Nordlys and MS Kong Harald - will undergo a full transformation to battery hybrid power, with the installation of new low-emission engines and large battery packs."
Carbon Emissions,"Across the seven ships, the upgrades, as well as the phasing in of sustainable biofuels, will reduce CO2 emissions by around 25% and cut NOx emissions by a massive 80%."
Carbon Emissions,"Hurtigruten Svalbard continues its path towards lower emissions with electric snowmobiles, increased use of solar panels, and battery powered catamarans custom built for polar water exploration."
Carbon Emissions,"Our collaboration with the Norwegian start-up Brim Explorer debuted in the spring of 2021, offering our guests the first sightseeing vessel in the world able to operate for a full day on electrical power."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, the quest for silent and emission- free tourism continued as we announced a partnership with Volvo Penta to power Hurtigruten Svalbard's new hybrid sightseeing vessel."
Carbon Emissions,"The near-silent vessel has the potential to transform the sustainable tourism industry, allowing our guests to experience the wonders of Svalbard without disturbing the nature and habitat around them."
Carbon Emissions,Another 2021 announcement came in the form of our collaboration with Norwegian transportation company Tide to operate Norway's first electric tour bus.
Carbon Emissions,This permits guests to travel on excursions with Hurtigruten Norway in a completely emission-free manner.
Carbon Emissions,"The bus will be used on various excursions from Ålesund, and we have plans to introduce more electric tour buses in 2022."
Carbon Emissions,"Every year, the Hurtigruten Norway fleet transports over 60,000 tonnes of goods - including everything from food to medicine - a distance of 600,000 nautical miles (around 1.1 million kilometres)."
Carbon Emissions,We are working closely with industry partners to drive change and move boundaries and are engaged in new build programmes that we will be excited to share more about when the timing is right.
Carbon Emissions,"We are also in active discussions with stakeholders about pilot programmes to develop and test the next generation of green propulsion technology, enabling us to continue to have the greenest fleet of vessels in the industry."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2019, road vehicles, such as cars, trucks and buses, accounted for 74% of the transportation sector's total greenhouse gas emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Therefore, safe and reliable mass transit presents significant opportunities for the transportation sector to expand the low-carbon economy."
Carbon Emissions,"As global demand for clean transportation continues to grow, Rogers will continue to develop materials solutions to meet this opportunity."
Carbon Emissions,"Rogers' PES solutions provide unique advantages for the transportation sector, especially in terms of mass transit."
Carbon Emissions,"Our ROLINX® busbars serve as power distribution highways for propulsion systems for rail, shipping and heavy equipment that require high power capabilities."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, power electronics used in mass transit auxiliary inverters and battery chargers must keep energy losses to a minimum."
Carbon Emissions,Our solutions keep these systems running with greater reliability and efficiency.
Carbon Emissions,"We innovate and design our materials for high-performance, durability and reliability to enable our customers' most demanding applications and support customer requirements leading toward enhanced sustainability solutions for the future."
Carbon Emissions,Our products are designed to meet rigorous international safety standards and are therefore often used where safe performance is essential.
Carbon Emissions,"For example, Rogers' BISCO® materials are widely used in seating solutions for mass transportation applications because of their durability and technical design, but especially because of their compliance with the most stringent UL flame ratings."
Carbon Emissions,"In these applications, our materials are more fire resistant and emit less harmful emissions when exposed to extreme conditions."
Carbon Emissions,"Similarly, Rogers' products have a reputation for reliability and durability, key characteristics for our customers' most challenging applications."
Carbon Emissions,"Our high-frequency specialty laminates, for example, enable radars and antennas on spacecraft launch vehicles, probes, landers and rovers for long-range communications."
Carbon Emissions,"As a result, the Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study Jupiter and Saturn, has now traveled outside the solar system and still continues to transmit information billions of miles back to Earth."
Carbon Emissions,"This standard of reliability and durability in Rogers' advanced materials translates into longer performance, less maintenance and reduced waste for our customers' products in everyday applications."
Carbon Emissions,"As these examples demonstrate, our product innovation and design supports our customers' solutions for hard to solve, real world problems."
Carbon Emissions,But we also direct our innovation and design toward specific industries where our advanced material platforms can enable solutions for a more sustainable future.
Carbon Emissions,"In each case, Rogers' engineering and design teams, working closely with our customer counterparts, developed solutions that are expanding EV/HEV availability and adoption globally as a more sustainable transportation solution."
Carbon Emissions,"At Rogers, we are a leader in the industry for developing material technology platforms that are designed with sustainability at the core."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2020, we were pleased to complete our first greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, which provides standards and guidance for organizations preparing a GHG emissions inventory."
Carbon Emissions,"A GHG emissions inventory is the foundation for developing, implementing and monitoring climate change mitigation and reduction initiatives."
Carbon Emissions,Participation in an annual GHG emissions inventory demonstrates an important step forward with regards to ESG and business transparency efforts.
Carbon Emissions,More information on Rogers' ESG commitments and targets will be shared in future reports.
Carbon Emissions,"By collecting 2019 and 2020 GHG emissions, Rogers has developed an initial baseline to track future GHG emissions progress and potential future expansion of the collection and analysis of the emission sources included in our carbon footprint."
Carbon Emissions,"In the future, we hope to expand these efforts by including additional sources and Scope 3 value chain emissions."
Carbon Emissions,Our manufacturing facilities are subject to local air emissions permitting and reporting requirements and our comprehensive management systems ensure our continued compliance with permit conditions and regulations.
Carbon Emissions,"To contextualize our emissions data, we use reporting metrics that account for these factors and monitor relative GHG emissions intensity by normalizing our global footprint according to net revenue."
Carbon Emissions,Emissions data for our GHG key performance indicators (KPIs) have been calculated using location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions1 .
Carbon Emissions,"Our 2020 GHG KPI is 84.70 tCO2 e per $ million USD revenue, based on $802.6 million USD 2020 revenue."
Carbon Emissions,Two of our 2030 RISE technology industry initiatives focus on collaborations within our ecosystem to accelerate progress on reducing climate impact in semiconductor manufacturing and advancing sustainable chemistry principles through the application of a chemical footprint methodology.
Carbon Emissions,Intel is committed to contributing to the global effort toward science-based approaches to GHG emissions reductions in line with efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C.
Carbon Emissions,"However, we face challenges in gaining formal approval for an emissions-reduction target under the existing methodology of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) due to a number of factors:"
Carbon Emissions,"The convergence approach within SBTi's sectoral decarbonization approach (SDA) enables consideration of early action, but there is currently no SDA for the semiconductor industry."
Carbon Emissions,"Second, demand for semiconductors is increasing, due in part to the role that technology plays in driving climate solutions."
Carbon Emissions,Current frameworks do not include consideration of the application of technology to reduce climate impact in global manufacturing.
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, emissions pathways for non-CO2 gases may differ from those for CO2 due to differences in factors such as mitigation potential."
Carbon Emissions,Process emissions for the semiconductor manufacturing industry include nonCO2 gases such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrous oxide.
Carbon Emissions,Consideration of sector-specific differences in emissions pathways for CO2 and non-CO2 GHG emissions is a potential area of importance for future research and for expanding opportunities for sectorspecific approaches to targets.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we continued to work with industry stakeholders to assess the potential for the development of a sectorspecific approach to setting science-based GHG emissions-reduction targets for the semiconductor manufacturing industry."
Carbon Emissions,The goal is to expand the number of companies in our sector setting sciencebased targets.
Carbon Emissions,Sustainable chemistry is a scientific concept that seeks to improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and services.
Carbon Emissions,"Sustainable chemistry encompasses the design, manufacture, and use of efficient, effective, safe, and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes."
Carbon Emissions,"Sustainable chemistry is also a process that stimulates innovation across all sectors to design and discover new chemicals, production processes, and product stewardship practices that will provide increased performance and value while meeting the goals of protecting and enhancing human health and the environment.1"
Carbon Emissions,"We intend to apply the chemical footprint methodology not only to Intel's direct manufacturing operations, but also to integrate the methodology within the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain both upstream and downstream of our manufacturing operations."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, Intel's Sustainable Chemistry Team continued efforts to refine the chemical footprint methodology for use in evaluation of the chemical supply chain, as well as to integrate the methodology into the chemical supply chain to enable better assessment of full lifecycle impact."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, we continued to provide webinars to further the promotion of the chemical footprint methodology as a technology industry initiative."
Carbon Emissions,"Sustainable chemistry baselines were completed for the current manufacturing technologies, as well as for the year 2020."
Carbon Emissions,"We also completed an initial analysis of current chemical uses, and those identified as the highest impact chemistries have been included within a set of priority projects to further scope and disposition."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2022, we plan to complete a proof of concept to enable visualization of the top impact chemical uses by mass and chemical footprint values, and to identify potential projects that will result in meaningful reductions in chemical footprint values."
Carbon Emissions,"As we continue to take actions to reduce Intel's own global manufacturing and supply chain climate footprint and to advance product energy efficiency, we have also taken on the global challenge to partner with the technology industry and other stakeholders to achieve carbon neutral computing by 2030."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, Intel announced plans in 2022 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations by 2040."
Carbon Emissions,"Conceptually, carbon neutral computing is achieved when the positive benefits of the ICT sector ""handprint""—the ways in which technology is applied to reduce climate impact across the economy—equals or exceeds the climate and energy ""footprint"" of product-related emissions and carbon embedded in technology systems."
Carbon Emissions,"Our global challenge framework includes partnering with others to accelerate the sustainability of PCs, improve the energy efficiency of data centers, and accelerate handprint projects to reduce emissions across high-impact industries such as utilities, oil and gas, and manufacturing."
Carbon Emissions,"Partnering with PC manufacturers, we are assessing the carbon footprint of PCs across their life cycles to identify carbon reduction opportunities."
Carbon Emissions,"To illustrate, Intel published the ATX12VO power supply specification, which provides higher platform power efficiency in a smaller footprint."
Carbon Emissions,"Together with Modern Standby, the latest ATX12VO desktop systems will have over 40% reduction in typical energy consumption relative to an average system.1"
Carbon Emissions,"In March 2022, Intel partner MSI announced the first ATX12VO system."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, Intel's Project Athena Desktops take advantage of both Modern Standby and the ATX12VO power supply unit to ensure smaller, more efficient form factors designed to help OEMs meet Energy Star and EPEAT environmental responsibility standards."
Carbon Emissions,"Based on power and performance optimization done in partnership with OEMs, Intel 11th Generation Intel® CoreTM mobile processor (Tiger Lake)-based systems achieve 16 hours of battery life on Windows2—double the eight hours of battery life in 2015."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition to enhanced battery life, Intel has set a new goal to lower emissions related to reference platform designs for client form factors by 30% or more by 2030."
Carbon Emissions,"These efforts are taking shape with Dell's Concept Luna prototype device, developed in partnership with Intel to showcase future possibilities for sustainable PC design."
Carbon Emissions,"In our efforts to reduce carbon footprint at a platform level, we are also implementing technologies across the product life cycle (manufacturing, use, and asset retirement)."
Carbon Emissions,"Specifically, we focus on reducing component count and the area of the main board, and increasing system and display energy efficiency."
Carbon Emissions,"For enterprises, the Intel vPro® Platform enables sustainable management throughout the entire device life cycle, enabling IT organizations to reduce emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"We have worked with our worldwide ecosystem to reduce data center carbon impact in two areas: 1) Lowering energy consumption during the compute ""use phase,"" which accounts for the primary source of data center carbon emissions; and 2) Reducing the embodied carbon in the equipment itself in the ""create phase,"" which represents roughly 10%-20% of emissions."
Carbon Emissions,Use phase. The primary source of emissions in the use phase is from electricity used to power the data center and network.
Carbon Emissions,"One of the ways we are reducing electricity use is through AI-based telemetry, which intelligently monitors and controls electricity in the data center and throughout the network."
Carbon Emissions,"Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors incorporate registers for monitoring cache, CPU frequencies, memory bandwidth, and input/ output (I/O) access."
Carbon Emissions,"These telemetry capabilities show the potential for significant energy savings at scale; within its data center that houses 5G communication facilities, Japan Telecommunications operator KDDI reduced overall electricity consumption by 20% in a trial using 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel's comprehensive power management and AI capabilities."
Carbon Emissions,"Create phase. Intel is focusing on efforts to reduce the carbon footprint at a platform level by enabling modular component design where CPU, I/O, and accelerator modules can be repaired or upgraded independently to extend the useful life of the platform."
Carbon Emissions,"Working alongside key data center partners, we are contributing to the Open Compute Project (OCP) to advance modular designs, establish carbon footprint metrics, and set reduction goals."
Carbon Emissions,"The most recent advancements are specified in the Blue Glacier project, which published a Revision 1 specification for modular design through OCP."
Carbon Emissions,Optimizing software for sustainability.
Carbon Emissions,"We work with the world's largest cloud and communications service providers, independent software vendors, and open source software communities to optimize hundreds of data center and network applications to address software inefficiencies."

Carbon Emissions,"Sherwin-Williams has voluntarily participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project's (CDP) Climate Change reporting since 2006 (2005 reporting year), which includes details about our greenhouse gas (GHG)-related risks and opportunities, corporate governance and climate change communications."
Carbon Emissions,"From 2009 to 2020, our climate strategy focused on reducing our GHG emissions intensity - the rate of GHG per 100 pounds of product produced - with a 2020 goal to reduce our GHG emissions intensity to 19 pounds of CO2 e per 100 pounds of total production, compared with a 2017 baseline of 20.2 pounds of CO2 e per 100 pounds of production."
Carbon Emissions,"We included emissions from our operations (Scope 1) and from the generation of purchased energy (Scope 2), and, in 2019, we added emissions data related to our upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 3)."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2020, we aligned our climate strategy to reflect a science-based target approach, influenced by global efforts to limit global warming to well-below 2.0 degrees Celsius."
Carbon Emissions,"Our goal is to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30% by 2030, compared with a 2019 baseline."
Carbon Emissions,"In our view, the benefit of setting an absolute goal, rather than an intensity goal, is that it aligns best with what the planet needs - an absolute reduction of GHG emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Starting in 2021, we plan to further evaluate our climate-related risks and opportunities and report our findings in our first disclosures using the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework"
Carbon Emissions,Sherwin-Williams has established a goal to increase renewable energy to 50% of total electricity usage by 2030.
Carbon Emissions,"To help us achieve this goal and our other 2030 carbon and climate goals, we will be exploring a variety of renewable energy mechanisms and tools."
Carbon Emissions,The charts below present total carbon emissions and total carbon emissions performance (intensity) for our global footprint.
Carbon Emissions,"Using 2017 (the year we acquired Valspar) as a baseline, we set a goal of a 2% reduction in our carbon intensity each year."
Carbon Emissions,"We outperformed the goal in 2018, 2019 and 2020."
Carbon Emissions,"After learning more about the sources of our emissions and ways to reduce them, we are introducing our total emissions goal for 2030."

Carbon Emissions,"Greenhouse gases are accounted for in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, applying the operational control approach and using emissions factors from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report."
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 1 includes Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases [carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)] as well as any non-Kyoto greenhouse gases emitted."
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 2 includes carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)."
Carbon Emissions,"Historical data considers any divestitures, mergers and acquisitions and may change to reflect those activities."
Carbon Emissions,Reported Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions showed little change from 2019.
Carbon Emissions,"This reflects offsetting emissions impacts from several factors including the number of scheduled outages for maintenance, COVID-19 impact on volumes, and emissions reduction projects."
Carbon Emissions,Scope 2 emissions reflect power purchases to supply manufacturing operations around the world.
Carbon Emissions,"These are calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, including both location-based and market-based methods."
Carbon Emissions,The market-based value is used in the corporate total for our 2030 emissions reduction target.
Carbon Emissions,Scope 2 emissions calculated using the location-based method were 4.9 million metric tons in 2020.
Carbon Emissions,Bio-based GHG emissions for 2020 were 0.458 million metric tons.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2020, Dow changed the methodology used to calculate the GHG Intensity metric."
Carbon Emissions,Emissions used in the calculation relate to the manufacture of materials and exclude emissions associated with the production of power and steam not consumed by the company.
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, the production volume used in this metric includes products produced by the company, including by-products and co-products generated from the production of olefins."
Carbon Emissions,The methodology for this calculation was applied to the presentation of historical GHG Intensity metrics.
Carbon Emissions,Scope 3 emissions are defined by the GHG Protocol as indirect emissions from value chain activities.
Carbon Emissions,Understanding the relative scale of the Scope 3 categories contributes to our strategies for targeting reduction initiatives.
Carbon Emissions,"Our estimates of Scope 3 emissions are made according to the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, as well as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain."

Carbon Emissions,"We know that rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the primary source of climate change, and we work to do our part to reduce and avoid emissions in our operations and supply chain."
Carbon Emissions,Ambitious goals help guide our programs and projects to reduce emissions.
Carbon Emissions,"McKesson Europe has set a goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2030, and in May 2021, McKesson Corporation committed to set science-based targets (SBTs) that address our enterprise-wide operational emissions and supply chain, in line with methodologies from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
Carbon Emissions,We expect to announce our SBTs in FY23.
Carbon Emissions,"These goals complement each other and exemplify our enterprise-first approach to tackling climate change: we know that different geographies will be impacted in different ways, but it is incumbent on our entire organization, as a leading enabler of better health outcomes worldwide, to reduce our emissions."
Carbon Emissions,McKesson Europe has reduced its emissions 9% on its way to its 2030 carbon neutral goal.
Carbon Emissions,We pursue certifications and use management systems that help us better track and recognize our environmental impacts.
Carbon Emissions,"In FY21, our business in Ireland was certified to the ISO 14001 standard."
Carbon Emissions,"In other European jurisdictions, we implemented environmental management systems that are informed by and similar to the ISO 14001 standard."
Carbon Emissions,"In FY22, we committed to set a science-based target to guide our emissions reductions."
Carbon Emissions,We expect our efforts to achieve our SBTs will include projects and initiatives in the following areas:
Carbon Emissions,Energy efficiency projects in our buildings
Carbon Emissions,Improving fleet efficiency and electrification
Carbon Emissions,Increasing our procurement of renewable energy
Carbon Emissions,Engaging with our suppliers to set their own SBTs
Carbon Emissions,"Our operational emissions stem from our use of fuel for our inbound and outbound distribution operations, and electricity and natural gas in our buildings."
Carbon Emissions,We focus on efficiency across these areas as we aim to reduce our emissions.
Carbon Emissions,"As an international business focused on distribution, transportation is important to us — in particular, improving fuel efficiency for our fleet."
Carbon Emissions,"For us, fuel consumption for transportation is an environmental challenge and opportunity. Our transportation strategy focuses on optimizing delivery routes and the efficient use of delivery vehicles."
Carbon Emissions,"To do that, we monitor mileage and fuel consumption, and we educate our drivers on eco-efficient driving."
Carbon Emissions,"In Europe and the United States, we use a standard route optimization software solution, which helps our drivers find the most fuel-efficient routes for deliveries."
Carbon Emissions,"Patients, pharmacies and hospitals depend on our medical supplies, making reliable and efficient last-mile delivery performance crucial to our business and customers' success and health."
Carbon Emissions,"This tool enables us to continue to fulfill our customer service levels while reducing mileage, saving time, cutting down emissions, and minimizing unused vehicle capacity."
Carbon Emissions,"In some geographies, we own our fleet."
Carbon Emissions,"When buying or leasing new vehicles, we look for key criteria including fuel consumption and low carbon emissions, as well as ensuring the vehicles adhere to high quality standards."
Carbon Emissions,"When we purchase or lease vehicles in the U.S., we specify such attributes as aerodynamic vehicle components to reduce drag and increase fuel economy."
Carbon Emissions,"We also use lightweight materials for key components, and engine mapping technology to increase fuel efficiencies."
Carbon Emissions,"Our fleet in North America has already seen the impact of these efforts, and we continue to adjust our fleet to increase efficiency."
Carbon Emissions,"For example, we are upgrading tractors and in Canada we have introduced trucks with an Espar system that helps reduce fuel use."
Carbon Emissions,"Trailers are also equipped with skirts that improve aerodynamics and help reduce fuel consumption, and we run bulkheads in our trailers for more efficient airflow and less use of refrigerant fuel."
Carbon Emissions,We are exploring additional opportunities to electrify our fleet.
Carbon Emissions,"In addition, we have replaced some internal combustion engine vehicles with electric delivery bikes."
Carbon Emissions,These bicycles enable us to reduce our fuel consumption related to deliveries.
Carbon Emissions,"In the U.S., we are enthusiastic at the prospect of increasing the number of electric vehicles we use to deliver key pharmaceutical and medical supplies across the country."
Carbon Emissions,We test EVs and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles to determine potential opportunities to incorporate them into our fleet and realize emissions reductions.
Carbon Emissions,We continue to explore additional opportunities to increase the electrification of our fleet and drive down fuel consumption.
Carbon Emissions,Reducing the environmental impact of our physical operations is an important part of becoming a more sustainable organization.
Carbon Emissions,"Our direct environmental impacts stem primarily from the operation of our more than 6,000 corporate offices, bank branches and data centers."
Carbon Emissions,"Our approach to operational sustainability consists of two key components: managing our carbon footprint by reducing our direct and indirect GHG emissions; and enhancing resource management and efficiency, which includes responsible stewardship of water, waste and other key resources across our operations."
Carbon Emissions,Creating actionable strategies for reducing our GHG footprint depends on having clear and comprehensive insight into our emissions sources and performance.
Carbon Emissions,"Since 2005, we have been measuring and publishing our operational GHG emissions and using that data to inform our strategies for reducing both our direct and indirect emissions, as well as offsetting the impact of the emissions we are not yet able to eliminate."
Carbon Emissions,"JPMorgan Chase's 2021 operational GHG emissions were driven by two primary activities: powering our buildings (e.g., electricity, heating and cooling) and business travel."
Carbon Emissions,Scope 1 GHG emissions include those from building operations and company-owned aircraft and vehicles.
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 2 emissions, from purchased electricity, are the largest driver of our building-related emissions and overall operational GHG footprint."
Carbon Emissions,The majority of our business travel-related emissions are Scope 3 emissions from commercially operated air and rail; reimbursed personal vehicle and rental car travel; and hotel stays.
Carbon Emissions,A small portion of our business travel emissions are Scope 1 emissions from company-owned aircraft and vehicles.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2020, we committed to achieve carbon neutrality across our operations annually."
Carbon Emissions,This commitment includes Scope 1 (direct) GHG emissions from building operations and company-owned aircraft and vehicles; Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions from purchased electricity; and Scope 3 (indirect) GHG emissions associated with business travel.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we met our carbon-neutral goal for the second year in a row, using carbon offsets to help us achieve neutrality."
Carbon Emissions,We are committed to maintaining carbon neutral operations each year going forward.
Carbon Emissions,Our strategy to maintain carbon neutral operations is focused on the following:
Carbon Emissions,Improving efficiency. Reducing energy use is our first priority.
Carbon Emissions,"We continue to undertake a variety of energy efficiency measures - for example, optimizing the use of heating and cooling in our buildings - and to expand their implementation across our operations."
Carbon Emissions,Sourcing renewables.
Carbon Emissions,"Next, we are focused on installing on-site solar systems at JPMorgan Chase properties and establishing long-term renewable energy procurement agreements (e.g., Power Purchase Agreements and green power supply contracts)."
Carbon Emissions,We are working to increase the proportion being met with on-site renewable energy and off-site long-term renewable energy contracts to 70% or more by 2025.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, over 20% of our renewable procurement came from these solutions."
Carbon Emissions,"Purchasing Energy Attribute Certificates (""EACs"") and carbon offsets."
Carbon Emissions,"To continue to meet our commitment to source renewable energy for 100% of our global power needs annually and address the remainder of our direct and indirect emissions, we purchase applicable EACs (e.g., Green-E certified Renewable Energy Certificates (""RECs""), International-RECs) and verified carbon offsets."
Carbon Emissions,"To build on our commitment to carbon neutral operations, in 2021 we announced a new target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions by 40% by 2030 versus a 2017 baseline."
Carbon Emissions,"As of the end of 2021, we had reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by approximately 15%."
Carbon Emissions,"Moving forward, we intend to make further progress by increasing our direct use of renewable energy, upgrading existing heating and cooling systems and optimizing building space."
Carbon Emissions,"Over time, as we strive to reduce our operational emissions through these measures, we anticipate needing to buy fewer offsets to neutralize our emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"As part of our science-based target commitment, we seek to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions 100% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline."
Carbon Emissions,"Scope 1 (Stationary and Mobile): All direct emissions from those activities under our control, including fuel combustion on-site such as gas boilers."
Carbon Emissions,Scope 2: Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used.
Carbon Emissions,Sustainability has become integral to our business culture.
Carbon Emissions,Our ESG strategy looks beyond reducing negative impact to positively impacting the environment through our operations.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, more than 40 energy efficiency projects were centrally funded, resulting in approximately 5,000 metric tons of annualized CO2e savings."
Carbon Emissions,"We developed four on-site solar projects, three of which (Pune, India; Suzhou, China and Bangkok, Thailand) started in 2021, with a fourth (East Long Meadow, North America) scheduled for construction in 2022."
Carbon Emissions,"These actions, along with purchasing energy attribute certificates and the virtual power purchase agreement mentioned below, keep us well on our glide path to our 2030 science-based target of going beyond carbon neutral across our operations."
Carbon Emissions,"In a major step toward achieving our 2030 carbon neutral and beyond goal, Stanley Black & Decker has executed its first virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Engie North America, a global leader in low-carbon energy solutions, to develop new wind energy in Texas."
Carbon Emissions,"This project, operational by the end of 2022, will continue to support Stanley Black & Decker's strategy to source 100% of its United States and Canada electricity needs from renewable power."
Carbon Emissions,"The efforts will deliver the equivalent of 54 megawatts of new wind power capacity or approximately 205,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable electricity annually."
Carbon Emissions,"Our Pune, India, facility has installed a 520 kWp Rooftop Solar System, which will provide 40% of the existing power needs, and result in a reduction of 550MT CO2e and 60,000 liters of water."
Carbon Emissions,Our approach to addressing climate change has accelerated in recent years in keeping with the scale and urgency of the issue.
Carbon Emissions,"Even as we achieved our 2020 ""drink in your hand"" goal to reduce our relative carbon emissions by 25% against a 2010 baseline, we increased our climate ambition."
Carbon Emissions,We've announced both our science-based target to reduce our absolute emissions by 25% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline and an ambition to be net zero carbon by 2050.
Carbon Emissions,"Several of our bottling partners have announced their own science-based targets and net zero pledges, which will help drive even more positive climate action across the Coca-Cola system."
Carbon Emissions,"In line with our net zero ambition, we conducted preliminary modeling in 2021 that will enable us to define the key actions and goals needed for a net zero transition by 2050."
Carbon Emissions,"A significant amount of our impact is in our supply chain, so we encourage suppliers—representing approximately 80% of spend across most major procurement categories—to respond to the CDP Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire."
Carbon Emissions,In 2021 we saw a threefold increase in the number of supplier responses compared to the previous year.
Carbon Emissions,"70 suppliers already had science-based targets in 2021, and an additional 49 suppliers have committed through the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to setting science-based targets in the near term."
Carbon Emissions,We believe that continued progress against our goals— in combination with supporting key stakeholders as they strengthen their own ambitions—will be critical to making meaningful advances on climate.
Carbon Emissions,We have also undertaken additional climate scenario risk analysis to better understand the potential near- and longer-term impacts of a changing climate on our business.
Carbon Emissions,The Coca-Cola Company applies the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in this report and in a TCFD Index and provides comprehensive disclosures to CDP on Climate Change.
Carbon Emissions,"The ESG and Public Policy Committee, established by our Board of Directors, bears the highest level of direct responsibility for climate-related issues."
Carbon Emissions,"The committee assists the Board in overseeing the company's environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public policy matters, including progress against our sciencebased target."
Carbon Emissions,"The committee reports regularly to the full Board on matters it oversees, including climate-related issues."
Carbon Emissions,"To learn more about our ESG governance structure, see the Governance section."
Carbon Emissions,"For more on climate-related governance, see our most recent CDP Climate Change response, Section C1"
Carbon Emissions,"Building on our first climate risk scenario analysis in 2019, we undertook a far-reaching new study across our company and agricultural supply chain in 2021, looking at three scenarios: Business As Usual1 (warming above 5°C), Middle of the Road2 (warming limited to 2.7°C) and Low Carbon3 (warming kept below 2°C)."
Carbon Emissions,This process enabled us to identify a refined set of climate-related risks and opportunities—including both physical and transition impacts—in a range of possible futures.
Carbon Emissions,This will be a critical tool for strategic planning and implementing resilience plans.
Carbon Emissions,We will further analyze the risks and opportunities identified to ensure we have appropriate risk-management strategies in place.
Carbon Emissions,We will disclose details in our forthcoming CDP Climate Change response.
Carbon Emissions,"Physical Scenario: IPCC AR6 SSP5-8.5 ""Fossil-fueled Development"" and Transition Scenario: IEA World Energy Outlook ""Current Policies Scenario"
Carbon Emissions,"Physical Scenario: SSP2-4.5 ""Middle of the Road"" and Transition Scenario: IEA World Energy Outlook ""Stated Policies Scenario."""
Carbon Emissions,"Physical Scenario: SSP1-2.6 ""Sustainable"" and Transition Scenario: IEA World Energy Outlook ""Sustainable Development Scenario."""
Carbon Emissions,"We have established a cross-functional and crosscompany Enterprise Risk Management process and Risk Steering Committee to oversee regular system-wide risk assessments, and we work to integrate climate risk planning into this process."
Carbon Emissions,"Relevant risks that could materially affect our business, including our financial results, are disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K."
Carbon Emissions,"These include risks relating to climate change, such as physical risks from changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters which may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities."
Carbon Emissions,"Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola system's bottling operations."
Carbon Emissions,"Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements, among others."
Carbon Emissions,"Achieving our science-based target means looking at our full value chain, including bottling partners and suppliers."
Carbon Emissions,"Our target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 includes system partners within our scope 1 and 2 boundary"
Carbon Emissions,Following are examples of how we are integrating our climate initiatives across our value chain and in collaboration with system partners.
Carbon Emissions,"Many of our agricultural suppliers report annually on their performance and progress in reducing emissions, which constitute 20-25% of our total value chain emissions, and on plans to achieve further reductions."
Carbon Emissions,"Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) include maximizing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, employing responsible forest management practices that protect biodiversity and restore degraded ecosystems, and maintaining or improving soils by preventing degradation—all of which are important in mitigating climate impacts."
Carbon Emissions,"To find out more, see Sustainable Agriculture."
Carbon Emissions,"Because packaging accounts for almost one-third of our overall carbon footprint, virtually everything we do toward our World Without Waste initiative also helps to achieve our science-based target."
Carbon Emissions,"This strategy includes more plant-based packaging that requires less petroleum-based virgin plastic; lightweighting our packaging; using more reusable packaging (both traditional refillables as well as fountain and Coca-Cola Freestyle dispensed solutions), using more recycled material; and recycling more bottles and cans."
Carbon Emissions,"For more about our packaging efforts, see World Without Waste"
Carbon Emissions,Approximately 10-15% of our emissions come from manufacturing.
Carbon Emissions,Renewable energy use as a percentage of total electricity for the system was 12% in 2021.
Carbon Emissions,"In February 2022, we released a Renewable Energy Implementation Guidebook, a step-by-step guide for companyowned facilities and bottling partners to build knowledge and increase facilities' generation and procurement of renewable energy."
Carbon Emissions,We also conducted analyses of renewable energy opportunities in six countries where implementation is more complex to support our teams in identifying renewable energy procurement options.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2022, we will continue to support operating units and bottling partners to further scale their use of renewable energy"
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we also re-joined the Clean Energy Buyers Association (formerly known as the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance) and are leveraging their resources and networks as we scale up our use of renewable energy"
Carbon Emissions,Cold drink equipment and dispensing accounts for approximately one-third of our emissions.
Carbon Emissions,"We are working to place more hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free coolers, replace older equipment with newer and more energy efficient coolers, as well as place more ""intelligent connected"" coolers that transmit data such as product throughput, maintenance status, temperature and energy use, which can improve our placement and management of coolers while reducing emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Due to an improvement in our data collection process and rigorous assessment of renewable energy claims throughout the system, this resulted in a drop in renewable energy use as a percentage of total electricity for the system from 17% to 12%."
Carbon Emissions,"Coca-Cola Europacific Partners completed Phase 1 of a three-phase solar development project at their facility in Wakefield, UK, the largest soft drinks plant in Europe."
Carbon Emissions,"The early results are promising, already saving £340,000 in 2021 with installation of an 8.2 megawatt solar system that accounts for almost 20% of the facility's electricity consumption."
Carbon Emissions,"By the completion of Phase 3, we expect that the project will generate an additional 30 megawatts in solar energy and include up to 40 megawatts of battery storage capacity, ultimately transitioning the facility to be carbon neutral by 2050."
Carbon Emissions,"Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from things we buy, and not what we do in our direct operations, engaging with suppliers is critical to achieving our science-based target"
Carbon Emissions,Our recent efforts include:
Carbon Emissions,"Each year we encourage key suppliers to disclose to CDP's supply chain Climate Change questionnaire, which provides us with useful data on the GHG emissions in our supply chain and information on supplier targets and initiatives to reduce their emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we requested 442 suppliers (up from 149 in 2020) to disclose, and 75% of these suppliers responded."
Carbon Emissions,We are proud to have been recognized by CDP as a 2021 Supplier Engagement leader for the third year in a row.
Carbon Emissions,This is an acknowledgement of our efforts to measure and reduce climate risks within our supply chain.
Carbon Emissions,We join the top 8% of companies who disclosed to CDP's full Climate Change questionnaire.
Carbon Emissions,We have piloted a questionnaire with 12 of our major suppliers across ingredients and packaging to begin moving toward supplier-specific emissions factors for the commodities we procure.
Carbon Emissions,This allows us to better understand our supply chain and more accurately track the emissions reductions of specific suppliers in key areas of our supply chain.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition initiative along with Atlantic Packaging, The Estée Lauder Companies, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Keurig Dr Pepper, Restaurant Brands International, Mars Incorporated, McCormick & Company, Mondelēz International, and Yum! Brands to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to support their climate journey."
Carbon Emissions,"We are witnessing the impacts of changing weather patterns, which is why investing in the resilience of our supply chain and the communities where we operate is critical to our long-term success."
Carbon Emissions,"Our work on resilience helps ensure we can withstand, recover from and adapt to the shocks and stressors of a changing climate."
Carbon Emissions,Many of our climate resilience efforts relate to our ingredient supply chain and water stewardship.
Carbon Emissions,"For more information, see our Sustainable Agriculture and Water sections, as well as our featured story about resilience in action"
Carbon Emissions,We are also sharing the outputs of our work on climate resilience with peer companies.
Carbon Emissions,"As founding members of the BSR Climate Risk to Resilience platform, we helped shape the development of resilience metrics and risk planning tools as well as the report Rising to Resilience (produced in collaboration with WWF and published in November 2020)."
Carbon Emissions,This report provides practical application for businesses on how to integrate climate resilience into their water stewardship strategies.
Carbon Emissions,Accurately measuring our impact and tracking reductions is essential to achieving our climate goal.
Carbon Emissions,We've recently implemented a new data system for collecting sustainability metrics and continually work toward ensuring that our practices are industry-leading.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we took significant steps to help facilitate complete and accurate progress reporting against our science-based target."
Carbon Emissions,We updated our GHG emissions accounting methodology for the Coca-Cola system aligned with the GHG Protocol and undertook an assessment to evaluate and expand the emissions sources included within our reporting boundary to align with requirements of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
Carbon Emissions,"In 2022, we plan to track our target progress in real-time across the system, putting us in a strong position to publicly report on progress against our target next year."
Carbon Emissions,"Across our system, many of our bottling and supplier partners have set their own science-based targets or have goals for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner."
Carbon Emissions,"In December 2021, the Coca-Cola system in Europe announced a goal to reach net zero by 2040 across all European markets, covering the entire European value chain, building on net zero and science-based targets set by The Coca-Cola Company's two leading bottling partners in Europe, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and Coca-Cola HBC."
Carbon Emissions,This effort seeks a reduction of 2.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent annually in Europe by 2030 compared to 2015—a reduction of 30%.
Carbon Emissions,"Complementing these net zero commitments, several of our other bottling partners have also announced their own science-based targets, including Swire Coca-Cola Limited (Asia) and Coca-Cola FEMSA (Mexico)."
Carbon Emissions,Additional details on Coca-Cola system emissions can be found in the Data Appendix.
Carbon Emissions,"As part of its ongoing commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, the fairlife facility in Coopersville, Michigan, partnered in 2021 with Generate, a company that builds, finances, owns and operates sustainable infrastructure such as energy, mobility and waste assets."
Carbon Emissions,"In the partnership, fairlife sends the liquid waste and organic matter waste produced during manufacturing at the facility to Generate's anaerobic digester about 30 miles away in Fremont."
Carbon Emissions,"The waste is broken down in the digester, and the resulting biogas that is produced is used to generate electricity."
Carbon Emissions,"While there are CO2 emissions associated with this approach, the net GHG emissions are much lower than if the organic waste had been sent to landfill where it would contribute to methane emissions, which have a warming potential 28-34 times that of CO2"
Carbon Emissions,"Between November 2021 and February 2022, the Coopersville plant has diverted 753 tons of organic waste, preventing the release of 461 tons of greenhouse gases."
Carbon Emissions,"This has produced over 1 million kWh of electricity and more than 175,000 gallons of organic fertilizer."
Carbon Emissions,"As climate change has already caused significant damages and irreversible consequences to our terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic marine ecosystems, taking steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change has become a front-of-mind issue."
Carbon Emissions,"Tencent has actively responded to the Paris Agreement's 1.5° C goal and China's ""3060"" goal, and is among the first Internet companies in China to announce our commitment to carbon neutrality."
Carbon Emissions,"We address physical risks posed by climate change during the site selection, design, and operations of our data centres."
Carbon Emissions,"Before selecting a site, we consider and assess the impacts of extreme weather, such as typhoons, rainstorms, floods, and high temperatures at the location."
Carbon Emissions,Our data centres are designed in strict compliance with the local requirements for discharging stormwater and pollutants as well as the design criteria of wind and rainfall.
Carbon Emissions,"In case of a sudden climate event at our operations, an emergency response steering team, with clearly defined tasks and responsibilities, will be dispatched to respond and evaluate the situation."
Carbon Emissions,Tencent has incorporated the climate-related risks into its overall risk assessment and management system to better cope with climate change and strengthen the climate governance structure.
Carbon Emissions,We have also identified climate-related risks based on the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations to develop a sound climate risk prevention strategy that is fully aligned with the global climate action.
Carbon Emissions,Climate-related risks and issues of the Company are considered and monitored by the Board via the Corporate Governance Committee.
Carbon Emissions,Climate change is regarded as a specific issue for revision and discussion.
Carbon Emissions,"During the reporting period, the Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed the Company's carbon footprint, net-zero goals, and decarbonisation pathways."
Carbon Emissions,We acknowledge that climate change brings physical and transition risks and opportunities to our business.
Carbon Emissions,"Our physical risks primarily result from acute and chronic risks caused by climate change, while transition risks mainly come from the market and policy changes that arise during the transition to a low-carbon economy."
Carbon Emissions,Reputational risks are linked to the potential failure in fulfilling our commitment to developing into a lowcarbon business.
Carbon Emissions,"On the other hand, climate change would also provide us with the opportunity to improve our energy efficiency and develop lowcarbon technologies and climate-resilient products and services."
Carbon Emissions,"In terms of physical risks, acute climate events caused by climate change, such as frequent typhoon weather and rainstorms, may affect our operational continuity."
Carbon Emissions,"On the other hand, chronic risks, such as high temperatures and droughts may increase energy consumption and operating costs for our offices and data centres. Rising sea or water levels may lead to loss of assets in certain regions."
Carbon Emissions,We have considered the impact of regional climate when allocating assets and have formulated emergency measures for acute climate events to avoid and reduce operational impacts or asset losses.
Carbon Emissions,There are transition risks as well.
Carbon Emissions,"In the context of accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, if we fail to effectively control or reduce the carbon emissions generated from our operations and provide low-carbon services and products, it may result in reputational damage, loss of users, or market share reduction."
Carbon Emissions,"Our carbon neutrality initiative follows the principle of ""prioritising the use of active emissions reduction measures while keeping the use of carbon offsets to a minimum""."

Carbon Emissions,Understanding How Climate Change Could Impact Our Business
Carbon Emissions,We are committed to transparency in evaluating the risks and opportunities that climate change may present to our business.
Carbon Emissions,"To meet this commitment, we incorporate the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework into our enterprise risk management governance process and voluntary report aligned with TCFD recommendations."
Carbon Emissions,See our TCFD Response on page 76.
Carbon Emissions,"Over the past years, we have made significant steps in our performance and achievements with regard to reducing our scope 1 and 2 carbon footprint and energy consumption, as well as maturing our scope 3 calculation."
Carbon Emissions,"Although we see many positive results and are making progress, we also realize that we are not there yet."
Carbon Emissions,"Our scope 1 and 2 carbon footprint strategy is built on three principles: reducing energy consumption wherever we can, using only green renewable energy, unless no other solution is possible or reasonably feasible, and compensating for the residual emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"Our target is to achieve scope 1 carbon neutrality by 2025, we aim to do this by direct energy saving of 100 TJ (or 2.5 kt) by executing the more than 25 projects we have defined in our master plan, adding renewable production of energy on our sites, optimizing the use of our m2 and relocating our employees to more energy-efficient offices (BREEAM certified) and implementing an off-setting strategy for the remaining emissions."
Carbon Emissions,"The main components of the energy-saving master plan are improving the energy efficiency of technical installations, improving energy management of our operations, and increasing the production of our own renewable energy. "
Carbon Emissions,"The table below, includes the top three key projects."
Carbon Emissions,"With regard to scope 2, our ambition is to increase the share of direct green energy purchases (so-called bundled renewable electricity) from renewable electricity produced close to our premises in the Netherlands, and to reduce the share of certificates."
Carbon Emissions,"For the US and Asia, our ambition is to purchase renewable energy attribute certificates (respectively RECs and IRECs) and monitor the evolution of renewable energy in those countries."
Carbon Emissions,Our scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C and are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) - under category 'near-term'.
Carbon Emissions,We recognize that environmental impact goes beyond our operations.
Carbon Emissions,"In general, most of the environmental impact of energy consumption in our value chain (scope 3) comes from the greenhouse gas emissions of our suppliers (upstream) and the use of our products at our customers (downstream)."
Carbon Emissions,"Results show that the indirect emissions (scope 3) from upstream and downstream value chains account for around 98% of the total emissions footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3)."
Carbon Emissions,"Of this, indirect emissions in the value chain, the category 'downstream' - use of sold products at our customers' sites - accounts for nearly 65%, and the category 'upstream' - emissions related to the goods and services we buy - accounts for 30%."
Carbon Emissions,"The remaining 5% of our scope 3 emissions relates to, among other things, activities linked to transportation, business travel, and commuting."
Carbon Emissions,Our scope 3 target for 2025 is to reduce the intensity level compared to our 2019 baseline of 0.55. The intensity is measured by the total scope 3 emissions (in kilotonnes) normalized to the total revenues (in € million).
Carbon Emissions,"Taking into account the change in product mix (an increase in the number of EUV systems sold) and the fact that our output in terms of product units manufactured is expected to increase, the overall emissions in the entire value chain are expected to rise."
Carbon Emissions,Our supplier sustainability program is a key enabler to reduce the upstream footprint.
Carbon Emissions,"And by executing our product energy efficiency strategy, we can reduce our downstream footprint."
Carbon Emissions,The Company has made recommendations to the government in the hope that the collaboration would speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan.

Carbon Emissions,Electricity accounts for nearly 80% of the energy we use at ASML. 
Carbon Emissions,"Most of our electricity consumption relates to the manufacturing of chipmaking equipment - from assembly to testing lithography and other systems - and maintaining consistent climate conditions, such as constant temperature, humidity and air quality."
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we secured a 10-year purchase agreement for green electricity for our installations in the Netherlands which will enable us to achieve our goal of using 100% renewable electricity in the Netherlands."
Carbon Emissions,"For our electricity consumption in the US, we also achieved 100% renewable energy."
Carbon Emissions,The renewable market situation in Asia is slightly different and more challenging - we are investigating various options to meet our ambitions there as well.
Carbon Emissions,"In 2021, we operationalized the 3,700m2 solar panels installed on our campus in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, which are expected to provide the equivalent of around 2.3 TJ per year."
Carbon Emissions,"We plan to expand the share of solar panels on our sites in the coming years in Europe, the US and Asia."
Carbon Emissions,We calculate our scope 3 emissions using guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol - the organization that provides widely used international standards for emissions reporting.
Carbon Emissions,We are continuously seeking to improve the data quality of our scope 3 calculations.

Carbon Emissions,"Those carbon credits can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company's sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk."
Carbon Emissions,"Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification."
Carbon Emissions,"The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process."
Carbon Emissions,The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption.
Carbon Emissions,The analysis of the inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company's strategy to reduce GHG emissions.
Carbon Emissions,"Since 2005, TSMC has also participated the international organization Carbon Disclosure Program (CDP) to publicly disclose climate change related information for 17 consecutive years and to continuously review and improve management practices through it."
Carbon Emissions,"In response to the commitment of global climate summit ""Paris Agreement"" and the Republic of China's ""Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act"" promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for corporate carbon management in 2016."
Carbon Emissions,"The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, carbon emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition."
Carbon Emissions,"In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, TSMC also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by the Fab Operations vice president."
Carbon Emissions,The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs.
Carbon Emissions,"Because more than 75% of TSMC's GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company always emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives."
Carbon Emissions,TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency of its facilities during operation.
Carbon Emissions,These efforts simultaneously reduce both carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs.
Carbon Emissions,"As a result, TSMC has conserved 2.4 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016."
Carbon Emissions,"From 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs' green power purchasing program for three consecutive years and became the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of green power."
Carbon Emissions,"Although the Taiwan Power Company stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with renewable energy suppliers in Taiwan."
Carbon Emissions,"Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy for the Company, TSMC has committed to achieving a target of 40% renewable energy by 2030."
Carbon Emissions,"Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption."
Carbon Emissions,All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon emission of electricity consumption in 2021 again. 
Carbon Emissions,"TSMC also used carbon credits to offset carbon emissions of natural gas consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero emissions for TSMC global offices. "
Carbon Emissions,"Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC has established a renewable energy task force and continues to communicate closely with government through the Association of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. "

Access to Health Care,The global health landscape continues to face a crisis of unprecedented dimensions.
Access to Health Care,"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only reversed progress made in the well-being and longevity of humanity, but the duration and future course of the pandemic remains unknown."
Access to Health Care,"Also uncertain are the implications for individuals suffering from other equally debilitating and deadly diseases or conditions, from cancer to pneumonia, as health care providers are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and routine procedures are canceled or delayed."
Access to Health Care,Innovation is among the most vital tools we can rely upon to help navigate these unchartered waters.
Access to Health Care,Our colleagues have continued to work tirelessly to help address evolving impacts of COVID-19 in addition to persistent pre-pandemic infectious and chronic diseases.
Access to Health Care,"Established in 2018, our Infectious Disease (I.D.) Impact Initiative is Pfizer's long-term global health commitment to redefine the way we fight infectious disease and help protect underserved people in the U.S. and around the world from deadly threats."
Access to Health Care,But we realize we cannot overcome global health challenges alone.
Access to Health Care,"Partnerships, whether it be among private entities or through publicprivate means, are more critical than ever before."
Access to Health Care,"True to Pfizer's Purpose, our priority is bringing to market innovations that positively impact patients."
Access to Health Care,"Over the last decade, we've been taking a hard look at our productivity, sharpening our focus, and implementing changes across dimensions."
Access to Health Care,"From our deep understanding of biology, doubling down on new modalities, and efforts to empower our scientists for critical decision-making, Pfizer's pipeline— including 89 programs in development from Phase 1 through registration (as of February 8, 2022)—reflects the scientific opportunity brought about by our focus on improvement."
Access to Health Care,Our approach is translating to results as we accelerate new medicines to market.
Access to Health Care,"We continue to see improvement in our Phase 2 success rate for new molecular entities (NMEs) on a five-year rolling average basis, as it quadrupled from 2015 to 2021, placing Pfizer among industry leaders."
Access to Health Care,Our Phase 2 success has also helped us achieve significant improvement in our end-to-end clinical success rates.
Access to Health Care,"By the end of 2021, Pfizer achieved a 21% success rate for NMEs in clinical trials from first-in-human (FIH) trials to regulatory approval - a fourfold increase from 5% in 2015."
Access to Health Care,This positions Pfizer with the potential to achieve one regulatory approval for every five new molecular entities entering the clinic for FIH trials.
Access to Health Care,"Significantly, most recent successes have been either first-in-class assets or innovations built on established mechanisms with novel scientific designs."
Access to Health Care,"Additionally, from 2017 to 2021, Pfizer reduced our FIH to Approval cycle time for new molecular entities by 14% (from 9.4 years to 8.1 years)."
Access to Health Care,"These reductions focus on operational activities—including strategy development, decision-making and clinical trial recruitment—where we can impact timeframes and find efficiencies."
Access to Health Care,"Pfizer is in line with the industry cycle time of approximately 8 years, with all planned development programs targeting less than 7 years."
Access to Health Care,"Our relentless focus on productivity results in greater social impact as we get more life-changing medicines into the hands of patients, and at a faster rate."
Access to Health Care,The critical importance of reducing our cycle times and increasing our clinical success rate was evident in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Access to Health Care,"We delivered a breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine, achieving Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), in record time with our partner BioNTech, as well as the Pfizer treatment PaxlovidTM (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets), which achieved FIH to EUA in less than one year."
Access to Health Care,"We scaled our COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing efforts and processes further, successfully delivering 3 billion doses worldwide as of February 2022, broadened regulatory authorizations to include children 5 years of age and up in several countries-with ongoing studies underway in younger age groups —and helped vaccinated individuals maintain vaccine protection through booster doses."
Access to Health Care,We will continue to follow the science and closely track emerging variants.
Access to Health Care,We know there is a great need to provide vaccine access to more people quickly— especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Access to Health Care,More on these efforts can be found on pages 14-17.
Access to Health Care,"In 2021, Pfizer's oral treatment for COVID-19, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir), received authorization or approval in the U.S., Israel and other nations."
Access to Health Care,Nirmatrelivir —the 3CL or main protease inhibitor in Paxlovid— was developed entirely in-house at Pfizer and is the first authorized oral 3CL protease inhibitor specifically designed to combat SARS-CoV-2.
Access to Health Care,"As an oral medication, it can be prescribed as an at-home treatment to help reduce hospitalization and deaths in patients at high-risk of developing severe illness, as well as potentially reduce the probability of infection following household exposure to COVID-19 among adults, subject to clinical success and regulatory authorization."
Access to Health Care,"We have entered into multiple agreements with countries around the world, and the U.S. government has committed to purchase 20 million treatment courses of Paxlovid in 2022."
Access to Health Care,"In addition, as part of our comprehensive strategy to work toward equitable access to COVID-19 treatments for all people, particularly those living in the poorest parts of the world, Pfizer entered into a voluntary license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed public health organization."
Access to Health Care,"The agreement facilitates sharing of intellectual property for the production of generic versions of our oral COVID-19 treatment, with the goal of helping to improve access to COVID-19 treatments to 95 low- and middle-income countries."
Access to Health Care,"Pfizer is very focused on applying the lessons from COVID to other programs - a philosophy we call ""lightspeed"" mentality."
Access to Health Care,"Following the successful launch of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, we took the next steps to potentially expand the application of the mRNA platform to diseases beyond COVID-19, leveraging the promise the platform holds for future breakthroughs."
Access to Health Care,"For example, Pfizer initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an investigational mRNA vaccine against influenza."
Access to Health Care,"Beyond the flu, Pfizer plans to explore mRNA in other respiratory viruses, as well as expand to develop mRNA technology in oncology, shingles and genetic diseases."
Access to Health Care,"Also within the oncology space, we are continuing development of elranatamab, an investigational bispecific molecule for the treatment of multiple myeloma."
Access to Health Care,"Although there are several approved therapies for myeloma, most patients will inevitably progress, and there remains a significant unmet need for innovative treatment approaches."
Access to Health Care,We are advancing the development of elranatamab as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents with the goal of improving outcomes for patients with this difficult-to-treat blood cancer.
Access to Health Care,"In addition, through an agreement with Arvinas Inc. and the acquisition of Trillium Therapeutics Inc. in 2021, we are investing in further potential breakthrough cancer therapies."
Access to Health Care,"This includes ARV-471, an investigational drug for breast cancer that selectively targets the estrogen receptor for degradation, and Trillium's lead molecule, TTI-622, which targets a key immune checkpoint involved in blood cancers."
Access to Health Care,"Additionally, our acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will allow us to advance development-stage therapeutic candidates for a range of immuno-inflammatory diseases."
Access to Health Care,"We continue to advance new vaccines against pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases, and explore the impact of applying groundbreaking technologies to help fight other infectious diseases where there have been no vaccine breakthroughs to date."
Access to Health Care,"For example, in 2021:"
Access to Health Care,"Pfizer initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of its investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate for older adults."
Access to Health Care,Pfizer received FDA approval for PREVNAR 20TM (Pneumococcal 20-valent Conjugate Vaccine) protecting adults against serotypes responsible for the majority of circulating pneumococcal disease.
Access to Health Care,Our commitment to developing these breakthroughs that change patients' lives extends across our research and development (R&D) portfolio. U.S. FDA regulatory policies recognizing breakthrough innovation among new medicines offer pathways for faster review and approval.
Access to Health Care,"Relative to industry, Pfizer's New Molecular Entity (NME) and Biologics License Application (BLA) approvals reflect a greater proportion of breakthrough therapy and expedited regulatory designations."
Access to Health Care,"Between 2017-2021, 45% of Pfizer NME and novel BLA applications approved by the FDA were designated as Breakthrough Therapies compared to 30% of industry Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) vaccine applications approved over the same period."
Access to Health Care,"Including other FDA designations involving expedited review between 2017-2021, 91% of Pfizer NME and novel BLA applications approved by the FDA achieved one (or more) expedited designations compared to 66% of industry CDER and CBER vaccine applications."
Access to Health Care,A core pillar of our ongoing product innovation work is our efforts to help slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) - one of the biggest threats to global health and a threat that has become even more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Access to Health Care,"As one of only a few large pharmaceutical companies still active in R&D of anti-infective therapies, Pfizer is continuously looking for solutions that target newly emerging infections."
Access to Health Care,"Slowing the spread of AMR requires a multifaceted approach across R&D, policy changes and reimbursement reforms, innovative surveillance, and an emphasis on active stewardship."
Access to Health Care,"Therefore, our strategy extends to innovative opportunities and unique partnerships that help improve infrastructure, education and access, enable comprehensive tracking, and expand the R&D pipeline."
Access to Health Care,Pfizer's recognition in the 2021 Access to Medicine AMR Benchmark reflects our industry-leading approach to combat AMR.

Access to Health Care,"To complement our diverse product portfolio, our ATLAS surveillance program - one of the largest in the world - provides public access to both antifungal and antibiotic resistance data, helping researchers and stakeholders better understand resistance patterns."
Access to Health Care,Pfizer's medicines and vaccines are created to help address the most challenging diseases of our time in areas of high unmet need.
Access to Health Care,But those breakthroughs will not change patients' lives if patients can't access or afford them.
Access to Health Care,"So, in addition to driving scientific innovation, we are focused on developing transformative approaches to access, affordability and delivery, modernized for the 21st century and reflected in our pricing methods."
Access to Health Care,"In 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion patients were treated or vaccinated by a Pfizer product1 (424 million patients excluding our COVID-19 vaccine and PaxlovidTM)"
Access to Health Care,"In 2021, an estimated 424 million patients were treated and/ or vaccinated by a Pfizer product1 , excluding our COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid."
Access to Health Care,"In our 2020 ESG report, we included two metrics - Patients Treated (420+ million) and Patients Reached (58+ million) through access and affordability programs."
Access to Health Care,We endeavored to streamline our reporting and clarify our impact by combining these two metrics into a single KPI to show the estimated totality of patients treated with Pfizer medicines and vaccines in 2021.
Access to Health Care,"As a result, the 2020 number is restated to reflect the new approach resulting in 399 million patients treated in 2020."
Access to Health Care,See table for detailed breakdown by distribution channel).
Access to Health Care,"To reduce the number of people who cannot afford our medicines, we are implementing:"

Access to Health Care,"New technologies, such as telehealth applications that reduce barriers to care and digital wallets with the potential to pass rebates directly to patients at the point of sale, reducing out-of-pocket costs."
Access to Health Care,"We set the price of our medicines and vaccines guided by the value our products bring to patients and society, achieving the broadest possible access; and with an understanding of the health systems and environment in which we operate."
Access to Health Care,"We partner and advocate with payers, governments and others in the health care system on behalf of patients to relieve their financial hurdles and provide access to our medicines at a cost they can afford."
Access to Health Care,We offer patient assistance and donation programs when insurance or reimbursement systems fail to provide affordable access to our medicines.
Access to Health Care,"And, building on our 30-year legacy of experience manufacturing biologics, our robust portfolio of biosimilars offers additional treatments at potentially lower costs."
Access to Health Care,"In addition to programs for patient affordability, we also use differential pricing models, considering the differing needs of populations, to advance equitable access by striving to ensure countries and patients with the least ability to afford medicines and vaccines pay a lower price compared to those with higher incomes."
Access to Health Care,"Our tiered pricing strategy also works within market, where prices are determined based on the specific circumstances of a given market or region."
Access to Health Care,"As part of this strategy, we engage in global commercial access partnerships with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, through which we committed to supply up to 930 million doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by 2027 to infants and young children around the world."
Access to Health Care,We've also invested in Sayana® Press to scale capacity of contraceptive delivery from 20 million units per year to 30 million.
Access to Health Care,We aim to ensure health systems remain financially viable in situations where earlier coverage of the newest medicines is needed for optimal health.
Access to Health Care,"We work toward longer term solutions using flexible payment models, including risksharing and value-based agreements."

Packaging Material and Waste,"Walmart's aspiration is zero plastic waste as part of a movement toward a circular economy, meaning a transition from a ""take-make-dispose"" approach to one that values the reuse and regeneration of materials and energy."
Packaging Material and Waste,"We work with suppliers, customers and communities to accelerate the adoption of circular packaging and products, including, but not limited to, plastics."
Packaging Material and Waste,Packaging plays an important role in protecting and delivering quality products to our customers.
Packaging Material and Waste,"But in most cases, packaging is simply a means to transport a product."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Once the end user has removed the packaging, it could become waste."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Approximately 51%16 of our private brand packaging is plastic, and Walmart customers, associates and other key stakeholders are increasingly concerned with it going to waste."
Packaging Material and Waste,Benefits of plastics: Plastics can provide enhanced food safety and prevent food waste and damage to other products.
Packaging Material and Waste,Plastics are lightweight durable materials that make transporting goods easier.
Packaging Material and Waste,Plastic often has a lower environmental footprint than paper or other materials in terms of carbon emissions and land usage.
Packaging Material and Waste,Problems with plastics: Approximately half of all plastics ever manufactured have been made in the past 15 years.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Increased plastics use, including that of single-use and non-recyclable plastics, means more plastics are ending up in our environment."
Packaging Material and Waste,"For instance, people use about 1 trillion plastic bags a year globally."
Packaging Material and Waste,"In the U.S., each bag is used for an average of 12 minutes and fewer than 10% are recycled."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Mismanaged plastics can harm wildlife, marine life and water systems."
Packaging Material and Waste,One study estimates plastic waste management will cost governments $670 billion and businesses $10 trillion by 2040.
Packaging Material and Waste,"To achieve zero plastic waste, we are working across our business, with suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other industry leaders to:"
Packaging Material and Waste,"Optimize product packaging at Walmart and beyond, using less plastic and aiming for 100% reusable, recyclable or industrially compostable packaging"
Packaging Material and Waste,Reduce reliance on plastic bags
Packaging Material and Waste,"Engage customers to reduce, reuse and recycle"
Packaging Material and Waste,Reduce operational waste
Packaging Material and Waste,Catalyze innovations in waste reduction systems
Packaging Material and Waste,Different plastic types require different intervention methods.
Packaging Material and Waste,"In an analysis, SYSTEMIQ and The Pew Charitable Trusts found systemic action is required by business, civil society and government to meaningfully decrease plastic pollution."
Packaging Material and Waste,"The study included a roadmap that outlines a combination of approaches that will help address the problem, including investments in new technology, increased recycling, reduction and reuse, expanded public policy, changes in consumer behavior, additional materials R&D and better recycling and waste management infrastructure."
Packaging Material and Waste,This roadmap builds on research from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that found recycling alone was not enough to fix the problem.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Rather, large scale reuse models and innovations are required to make plastics more reusable, recyclable or compostable."
Packaging Material and Waste,These insights show that there is no single solution to achieving a circular economy.
Packaging Material and Waste,Reaching this goal will require all of us to use a number of current approaches and develop new ones as well.
Packaging Material and Waste,Walmart is working with our suppliers and the broader retail consumer packaged goods industry to optimize packaging.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Our ambition is to accelerate a transition to 100% reusable, recyclable or industrially compostable packaging."
Packaging Material and Waste,"As a starting point, we have set a goal to achieve this ambition for Walmart private brand packaging by 2025; we are currently at 59%."
Packaging Material and Waste,We are also working with North America private brand teams to achieve 20% post-consumer recycled content by 2025.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Globally, we seek to achieve 17% of Walmart private brand plastic packaging made of post-consumer recycled content by 2025; our progress is 9%."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Inspire ambition and measurement among suppliers and beyond: We have asked our private brand suppliers to measure their packaging baseline, work toward 100% packaging that is recyclable, reusable or industrially compostable by 2025 and report progress."
Packaging Material and Waste,We share progress in the Goals & metrics section.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Through Project GigatonTM, we encourage suppliers to set their own targets for reducing waste, reusing materials and using recycled materials."
Packaging Material and Waste,"To help inspire commitment across the industry more broadly, we joined the U.S., Canada and U.K. Plastics Pacts."
Packaging Material and Waste,"The initiative seeks to unify businesses, government entities, NGOs, researchers and other stakeholders around a common vision for the circular economy for plastics as outlined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Initiative."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Walmart also co-leads the Consumer Goods Plastics Coalition working group, focused on engaging other retailers and manufacturers."
Packaging Material and Waste,"This year, the Coalition helped introduce ""Golden Design Rules"" to encourage reducing plastic use and improving recyclability by phasing out problematic materials, colors and labels from packaging."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Identify packaging use cases and potential interventions with the greatest potential for progress: In 2020, we worked with SYSTEMIQ to analyze Walmart U.S. private brand packaging, assess packaging reduction and identify the best innovations to pursue."
Packaging Material and Waste,"The categories selected for the analysis were: expanded polystyrene (EPS) meat and seafood trays, beverages, flexible fresh food, household chemicals and personal care and beauty."
Packaging Material and Waste,We found that actions to reach our goal vary by material and product type.
Packaging Material and Waste,We have shared the SYSTEMIQ data and findings with relevant business areas and suppliers.
Packaging Material and Waste,Merchants and private brand teams are working with suppliers to incorporate the findings into their current efforts and are developing pilots to reduce plastic packaging.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Provide tools and other resources: We provide resources to suppliers such as the Walmart Recycling Playbook, a resource developed by Walmart in collaboration with The Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR), the Sustainable Packaging Coalition and Pure Strategies."
Packaging Material and Waste,The Playbook provides criteria for streamlined packaging design and can be found on Walmart's Sustainability Hub.
Packaging Material and Waste,"The Hub contains additional tools, trainings and informative videos."
Packaging Material and Waste,"The Walmart Recycling Playbook is available to any company, not just Walmart and Sam's Club suppliers."
Packaging Material and Waste,There has been an explosion of attention on plastic packaging waste.
Packaging Material and Waste,"However, there is not yet access to a shared science-based tool that will run scenarios, compare packaging design choices and evaluate system investments."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Solutions require convergent action across the value chain, based on shared evidence."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Without such a tool, action is likely to be slower, fragmented and less effective at delivering critical economic, environmental and social outcomes."
Packaging Material and Waste,"According to The Recycling Partnership (TRP), a key gap today is a simple way for decision makers to understand the economic and environmental implications of plastic circular solutions in order to prioritize among different options."
Packaging Material and Waste,"With the support of Walmart, The Recycling Partnership and SYSTEMIQ came together to help accelerate industry adoption of circularity commitments through the development of PlasticIQ, a scenario modeling tool to help U.S. companies set effective circularity strategies."
Packaging Material and Waste,The tool is freely available in the U.S. here.
Packaging Material and Waste,"To help associates work toward our plastic packaging commitments, Walmart provides guidance and best practices through a regular sustainable packaging tips email."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Share best practices: In November 2020, Walmart hosted a virtual Sustainable Packaging Innovation Summit with more than 3,000 participants."
Packaging Material and Waste,The summit explored solutions to the plastics problem and provided guidance on how to spur action and achieve reduction goals.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Walmart leaders, suppliers and NGOs addressed trends in innovation, public policy and the importance of elimination, reduction and reuse."

Packaging Material and Waste,"The research found viable alternatives to EPS and outlined considerations of the various choices, such as cost, recyclability and performance based on various use cases."
Packaging Material and Waste,A report sharing the key research findings is planned to be publicly available in fall 2021.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Walmart is one actor and achievement of our zero-waste aspiration is dependent on many factors, including the availability and quality of recycling and waste management infrastructure where Walmart operates and in customer communities."
Packaging Material and Waste,Walmart also depends on the availability of recycled content in quantities sufficient to meet needs and at competitive prices.
Packaging Material and Waste,"These industries are fragmented, limiting options to scale solutions."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Success requires associates, suppliers and customers to be engaged."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Frontline associates have competing business priorities, including inventory management and customer service, and sourcing and merchandising associates must balance a number of factors in making decisions about products."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Suppliers must be willing and able to implement product design and packaging options consistent with Walmart's objectives, and customers need to be engaged in positive, circular action, overcoming low customer recycling and reuse rates."
Packaging Material and Waste,Walmart's business will continue to evolve and grow.
Packaging Material and Waste,"This growth and changes in our model may require an expansion of our footprint, which may create pressure on our targets."
Packaging Material and Waste,Customer expectations regarding product design and packaging must be met.
Packaging Material and Waste,"In many areas, the public policy environment does not support waste prevention or management (including recycling), including through a lack of incentives to scale alternatives that reduce waste."
Packaging Material and Waste,Balkanized laws and regulations across Walmart's operational footprint limit our ability to scale single solutions.
Packaging Material and Waste,Innovative materials and product designs are needed.
Packaging Material and Waste,Single-use plastics are currently necessary for health and safety and optimal for cost and convenience; alternative materials that do not cause other environmental harms do not yet exist for all use cases.

Packaging Material and Waste,"We use a variety of packaging materials and, as part of our Sustainable from the Start program, emphasize sustainability in all of our packaging."
Packaging Material and Waste,We also recognize that plastic packaging in particular has caused significant concern among stakeholders.
Packaging Material and Waste,PepsiCo's sustainable packaging vision is to build a world where packaging never becomes waste.
Packaging Material and Waste,"Our strategy is based on three inter-connected pillars: reduce, recycle, and reinvent."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Through each of these three pillars, PepsiCo strives to lead change through active partnerships and stakeholder engagement."
Packaging Material and Waste,Reducing packaging supports our climate ambition and decreases the amount of plastic we put on the market.
Packaging Material and Waste,"To achieve reduction we will utilize several levers including designing packaging to minimize the use of materials, switching to alternative, environmentally friendly materials, and working to reinvent packaging to reduce the need for single use plastics through reusable or low/no package models. For example, to reduce plastics across primary, secondary and tertiary packaging, we have light-weighted our bottles, reduced thickness of our films, and cut down on shipping and other packaging materials."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Our R&D teams are developing new technology that will pre-settle our snacks products in order to use a smaller bag for the same amount of product, further reducing our use of plastic."
Packaging Material and Waste,"We recognize that, while we cannot change recycling and recovery rates around the world on our own, we have a role to play in supporting recycling systems through our investments and partnerships."
Packaging Material and Waste,"For example, together with peer companies, through the American Beverage Association, non-profit partners WWF and The Recycling Partnership, and local governments, we launched an initiative called Every Bottle Back to invest in recycling infrastructure upgrades, expand access to recycling and support community education efforts in the United States."
Packaging Material and Waste,"Increasing collection and recycling rates supports a circular economy by ensuring the materials we put to market are recovered, their value is preserved, and they do not end up as litter or in landfills. We seek to improve collection and recycling infrastructure through policy and programs as well as consumer education and engagement."
Packaging Material and Waste,PepsiCo has endorsed the Consumer Goods Forum EPR position paper to support constructive policy engagement to improve recycling infrastructure across the globe.
Packaging Material and Waste,Throughout all of these efforts we are striving to promote a safe and inclusive waste management system for those working informally in the sector.
Packaging Material and Waste,Demand for recycled materials is important to increase material value and create a pull in the market to further increase supply.
Packaging Material and Waste,"This is why PepsiCo is seeking to increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging by identifying new suppliers for recycled PET (rPET), the main plastic used to make beverage bottles, and investing in new technologies."
Packaging Material and Waste,"PepsiCo's reinvention efforts focus on improving the environmental impact of our packaging by developing plastics from non-food, plant-based sources and exploring biodegradable or compostable options."
Packaging Material and Waste,"We're also transforming our offerings to deliver high quality beverages and snacks without the need for single-use packaging. We are developing and helping to provide new business models and solutions for consumers, including through offerings such as SodaStream, SodaStream Professional, powders, and concentrates."
Packaging Material and Waste,PepsiCo is a member of several consortia and partnerships to develop innovative packaging solutions.
Packaging Material and Waste,"These include the NaturALL Bottle Alliance, a research consortium to accelerate the development of packaging made with sustainable and renewable resources, and Danimer Scientific who we are working with to develop biodegradable film resins to be used for next-generation snacks packaging."
Packaging Material and Waste,"In 2020, we used approximately 2.4 million metric tons of plastic to package products throughout our food and beverage portfolio, including primary, secondary, and tertiary packaging."
Packaging Material and Waste,We highlight the following areas of progress within each pillar of our sustainable plastics vision.
Packaging Material and Waste,"In 2020, we reduced the virgin plastic footprint of our beverage portfolio by 3 percent against our 2018 baseline."
Packaging Material and Waste,"In 2020, PepsiCo joined Pulpex Limited to further develop and scale the world's first recyclable paper bottle, initially developed by Diageo and Pilot Lite."
Packaging Material and Waste,We also phased out all plastic packaging from for our bubly brand and piloted molded pulp fiber and paperboard replacements for our plastic 6-pack carriers in the U.S. Lessons from these pilots will inform initiatives in other regions.
Packaging Material and Waste,"We estimate that in 2020, approximately 87 percent of our packaging worldwide was fully recyclable, compostable and biodegradable."
Packaging Material and Waste,"While we phase out materials that are problematic in the recycling process, such as non-recyclable labels, we continue searching for solutions to improve the recyclability of flexible snacks packaging and to increase consumer access to recycling for materials like shrink wrap, which present a challenge to PepsiCo and the industry overall."

Labor Management,"Based on the Act, Toshiba developed an action plan aimed at increasing the percentage of female exempt employees to at least 7% by the end of FY2020."
Labor Management,"However, it stopped short at 5.1%, partly due to factors such as the subsequent status of Toshiba brought by organaizational and business restructuring."
Labor Management,"In the second-term action plan formulated in April 2021, Toshiba and key Group companies* set a target percentage of female exempt employees at 8% to be achieved by the end of FY2025 through systematic human resource development and mid-career employment."

Labor Management,"In 2020, the Company announced its Product Diversity Office (PDO) as the authority on embedding diversity and inclusion (D&I) into its product design and development process."
Labor Management,"The PDO's ""Diversity by Design"" process employs user experience and design experts who ensure diversity is represented in considerations for the product planning and execution phases."
Labor Management,"Additionally, the PDO consults with a broad range of diverse users to validate designs and provide feedback from engaging employees through partnerships with employee resource groups and diversity partners."
Labor Management,"As new products and solutions make their way through the development pipeline, the PDO will support the identification of the eight ""high risk"" areas where D&I may be a factor in design development, including facial recognition, voice user experience, gestures, wearables, head- or bodymounted devices, AI algorithms, and new form factors and interfaces."
Labor Management,"For products developed under the new PDO recommended process, before a product can move forward from the ""Design Start"" phase, a Diversity by Design Review Board (DDRB) comprised of members of the Company's Legal, HR, User Experience (UX), Customer Experience (CX), Quality and Product Accessibility teams will determine if a product requires expert review and user testing for diversity aspects."
Labor Management,"If it requires review, further evaluation and usability tests are conducted. If it does not require review, it's cleared to proceed through the design process as planned."
Labor Management,"Because of its use and involvement of ""high-risk"" factors for diversity, such as AI and voice, the first product to pilot the PDO program was the Lenovo Voice Assistant."
Labor Management,"Due to the software utilizing third-party services in its programming, the PDO board directed the product development team to obtain the external party's testing documentation to evaluate and verify the scope of the diversity testing performed in their development processes."
Labor Management,"The external audit successfully met the diversity testing requirements, and Lenovo Voice Assistant was cleared to move forward in its development and was deployed worldwide as a pre-loaded feature in Lenovo's X1 Fold."
Labor Management,"The PDO is also collaborating with the Company's User Experience Design Insight team to conduct research with individuals with visual impairments to gain insights on their experiences with its technology, which allows the product design to be more accessible."
Labor Management,"The Company recently partnered with Intel to conduct a comprehensive research study in five markets to understand the perceptions, gaps, wants, and needs of employees across all generations when it comes to diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and the critical role technology will play"
Labor Management,"The joint global study explores how people around the world view D&I in their personal and professional lives, and their perspective on the role technology plays to address systematic inequities, create more access, and enable growth."
Labor Management,"With the power to bridge accessibility gaps, connect people who are otherwise divided, and expand the impact of upskilling and progressive training programs, technology facilitates the ability to work in more dynamic, flexible ways than ever before."

Labor Management,We provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees with physical and mental disabilities.
Labor Management,Apple's voluntary decision review enables employees to have an employment decision reevaluated.
Labor Management,"This is designed to promote fairness and impartiality, in line with our values and policies. The reviewer will consider any new information that indicates the decision may not have been in accordance with our policies and guidelines"
Labor Management,"We believe that open and honest communication among team members, managers, and leadership fosters an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can participate, develop, and thrive."
Labor Management,"Team members are encouraged to come to their manager with questions, feedback, or concerns."
Labor Management,Our goal is to listen and learn—and to use those lessons to build an even better work environment for all.
Labor Management,"We regularly conduct surveys that gauge sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance, and inclusivity."
Labor Management,"Teams and leaders are encouraged to engage in meaningful dialogue informed by the survey results, and to create action plans that are shared, along with the survey results, with Apple's leadership."

Labor Management,Our work here doesn't stop at our own doors.
Labor Management,We're making progress toward building an Apple community that represents the diverse and ever-changing world around us.
Labor Management,"Since 2014, the number of employees from underrepresented communities (URCs) has increased by 64 percent in the U.S. and the number of female employees worldwide has grown more than 70 percent."
Labor Management,"And we're focusing on robust diversity recruiting efforts for R&D and leadership to accelerate progress in hiring across technical, engineering, and leadership roles. In 2020, 43 percent of open leadership roles were filled by people from underrepresented communities in the U.S., and 37 percent of open leadership roles were filled by women globally."
Labor Management,We're also expanding our diversity outreach efforts through organizations like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) that serve and engage talent from underrepresented communities.

Labor Management,"We have over 160,000 talented employees across the world. And we are proud that when people join Apple, they find fulfillment for many years."
Labor Management,That also means increasing overall representation takes time.
Labor Management,"Every hiring decision is made one role, and one person, at a time. We are taking meaningful actions for more diverse representation across every part of the business."
Labor Management,Because just 1 percent of over a hundred thousand represents change for over a thousand people.
Labor Management,"Apple team members have access to career development programs, ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support throughout their career journey."

Labor Management,"When people feel heard and respected, a sense of belonging and inclusion follows."
Labor Management,We also know that diverse and inclusive teams are more successful and innovative.
Labor Management,"Since signing the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge in 2017, we have hosted an annual CEO Day of Understanding, which helps us strengthen the power of inclusion at Trane Technologies."

Labor Management,"In May 2021, we announced that our annual incentive plan for leaders, historically based on financial performance metrics, would include an ESG factor based on several sustainability metrics."
Labor Management,The incentive plan consists of an annual target for increasing women in management roles globally and increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S. salaried workforce.
Labor Management,"These goals support our company's 2030 Sustainability Commitments to achieve gender parity in leadership, a workforce diversity reflective of our communities, and community initiatives that support equitable education and pathways to green and STEM careers."

Labor Management,We require participation from our people leaders but encourage all team members to engage in the program

Labor Management,I'm so grateful that CPB and the Foundation created this vital business program for Hawaii.
Labor Management,CPB makes the health and safety of employees a top priority as we continue to navigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Labor Management,"From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, CPB's Executive Committee provided frequent and comprehensive updates on the organization's pandemic response at all levels of the organization via telecasts and video conferences."
Labor Management,"Among the operational guidelines to ensure the highest levels of sanitation and safety, our employees are required to complete an online health daily health survey, AlohaSafe, when scheduled to work."
Labor Management,The web-based application tracks employees' health and recent travel to assist management in ensuring those who may be ill or at a high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to exposure do not come on-site to work.
Labor Management,All employees whose positions allow them to work remotely are encouraged to do so.
Labor Management,"CPB provides employees with computers, monitors, and the technology to work seamlessly from home along with a stipend that may be used to fund work from home tools when necessary."
Labor Management,"Employees who work on-site or whose roles require interacting with customers are provided personal protective equipment, plexiglass barriers, and reconfigured workspaces to limit possible employee and customer exposure to COVID-19 and to enable physical distancing."
Labor Management,"In 2021, CPB hosted four on-site vaccination clinics to bring both flu and COVID-19 vaccines to employees."
Labor Management,"CPB's internal vaccination rate is over 95%, and continuing education and access to vaccinations and boosters remain part of our ongoing effort to raise awareness and increase community immunity."
Labor Management,I very much appreciate the thoughtfulness and thoroughness with which CPB approached the COVID-19 situation.
Labor Management,"Moreover, the offers to vaccinate employees and to do ongoing testing at the company's expense, truly showed that leadership cared, not only about our well-being, but also about the health and well-being of our families and the community in general."
Labor Management,It made me proud to be a CPB employee.
Labor Management,And many of our films and series have been honored by the industry.

Labor Management,Netflix secured 17 nominations for the 2021 GLAAD Media Awards honoring LGBTQ+ representation in U.S. TV and film.
Labor Management,"However, for decades, historically underrepresented communities have been either defined by a single story or worse, entirely absent from our screens."
Labor Management,Research shows that more perspectives behind the camera leads to better representation in front of the camera.
Labor Management,So last year we created the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity to help create new opportunities for underrepresented communities within the entertainment industry.
Labor Management,"The fund includes a commitment of $100M dollars over five years to help develop a strong, diverse pipeline of creatives around the world."
Labor Management,"In our first 12 months, we worked with over 25 organizations globally - committing $14.5M towards programs that help identify, train and provide work placements for underrepresented creatives around the world."
Labor Management,"Of that, over $5M is specifically to support women."
Labor Management,"Several of these programs have already enabled new filmmakers to hone their craft by providing them with mentorship and development, as well as an opportunity to create short films."
Labor Management,"While we're still early on in this work, we're committed to helping build a legacy of inclusion in the industry."
Labor Management,Co-Curious is thrilled to be a recipient of Netflix's fund for creative equity and look forward to welcoming a new group of talented writers to the upcoming program.

Labor Management,"SaskTel uses a best value approach in all its purchase transactions, and where possible, goods and services are purchased through a competitive procurement process."
Labor Management,"These factors consist of a supplier's financial and nonfinancial capabilities such as people, products, quality, services, and transition plans, but also, their business practices related to ESG."
Labor Management,"Suppliers are given the option to answer questions related to diversity and inclusion, health, environment, and safety."
Labor Management,"The questions are not mandatory, however, suppliers are encouraged to complete them, as it is a good indicator if they are a company SaskTel would like to do business with."
Labor Management,SaskTel also provides an equitable opportunity for organizations within the province to compete for SaskTel procurement opportunities.
Labor Management,This enables small and medium sized businesses to provide economic sustainability for many in their community.
Labor Management,"In the 2020/21 period, 73% of our suppliers were located in Saskatchewan."
Labor Management,"SaskTel endeavours to promote Indigenous economic development by looking to increase contracting opportunities and access to procurement opportunities by First Nation, Metis, and Inuit people."
Labor Management,SaskTel began including weighted criteria in market events (where appropriate) which awards suppliers who identify their business as Indigenous owned (at least 51% of the firm is owned and controlled by Indigenous people).
Labor Management,"SaskTel officially became a Signatory to the Indigenous Engagement Charter on Aug 24, 2020 and committed to a target of 5% Indigenous spend as a percentage of local spend in our approved strategy over the next three to five years."
Labor Management,"In a year like no other, our people worked tirelessly to ensure that our customers and our communities were safe and had the connectivity they needed to keep in touch during these challenging times."
Labor Management,"Our people took great pride in going above and beyond when the province needed them most, whether it was raising money for foodbanks, donating to causes near and dear to their hearts, putting out fires and restoring services, providing a safe way for our customers to get the devices they needed, or ensuring the continuity of our network."
Labor Management,"Amongst all the challenges, our skilled workforce remained committed to transforming SaskTel for the future and ensuring that we live up to our customer expectations."

Labor Management,Our culture takes it a step further by describing who we are.
Labor Management,"There are three over-arching themes for these critical components that define SaskTel: our people, our customer, and our business."
Labor Management,The related principles and their corresponding behaviours define our collective beliefs and desired cultural state.
Labor Management,"Diversity and inclusion continue to be important goals at SaskTel, focusing on employment equity and ensuring employees within the organization are treated in a fair, equitable, and transparent manner."
Labor Management,"Creating a safe workplace environment where individuals can openly share diverse perspectives, backgrounds and ideas improves engagement and fosters greater innovation across the entire organization."
Labor Management,"To maintain this amazing workforce, SaskTel has long partnered with its employees to empower them to take charge of their careers and perform the best they possibly can. These standards have helped SaskTel develop a strong corporate culture that emphasizes personal accountability alongside being active members of the communities we serve."
Labor Management,SaskTel has been a member of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission (SHRC) Employment Equity Program since 1982 and is recognized as an equity partner.
Labor Management,"A Representative Workforce Strategy (RWS) was developed to achieve the desired outcome of representation throughout the organization, across all job classifications and equity categories."
Labor Management,"To support having a workforce that is reflective of the province we serve, SaskTel continues to focus on the four equity groups identified by SHRC:"
Labor Management,"SaskTel continues to have aggressive hiring goals to meet the targets established, primarily focusing on the recruitment of Indigenous people and people with disabilities."
Labor Management,"The Equity Hiring Program allows SaskTel to be competitive with other employers, through the ability to offer positions to potential candidates by creating opportunities proactively, rather than having to wait for actual vacancies."
Labor Management,"Hiring managers have two options for leveraging the program, an overhire into a permanent position with SaskTel Human Resources funding provided for 12 - 18 months, or a temporary Career Launch position for up to one year."
Labor Management,The Career Launch Program gives an employee the opportunity to gain relevant SaskTel experience and provides managers a chance to evaluate the employee's long-term potential.
Labor Management,The ability to secure and retain meaningful employment is still a very real challenge for people with disabilities.
Labor Management,The value they bring to an organization is often overlooked due to barriers such as daunting recruitment practices or the lack of support services available within the workplace.
Labor Management,"SaskTel's Supported Employment Program works to overcome those barriers, by connecting with individuals with cognitive disabilities who might not otherwise secure meaningful employment."
Labor Management,The program works with community-based organizations to identify candidates that can be integrated into SaskTel's workforce.
Labor Management,"SaskTel then works with our union, Unifor, to create an employment opportunity."
Labor Management,SaskTel currently employs 15 individuals under the Supported Employment Program.

Labor Management,"The events are open to all employees, in person or virtually from district locations around the province."
Labor Management,The Indigenous Engagement Charter is an initiative put forth by the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce to enhance Indigenous engagement for Saskatchewan businesses.

Labor Management,"In addition, we formulate and implement individual improvement measures that require overtimeheavy organizations to develop more efficient labor-saving practices."
Labor Management,"As a result, in the fiscal year ended March 2021, MC came very close to achieving those objectives, with employees on average taking 55% of their paid leave and working 27.2 hours of overtime per month on a non-consolidated basis."
Labor Management,"MC has established a Basic Policy on Preventing Harassment, which is disseminated widely throughout MC."

Labor Management,"We foster an environment of inclusion for candidates and employees alike, where all people can feel like they belong."
Labor Management,"People are diverse on multiple dimensions, some visible and some not."
Labor Management,Some dimensions of diversity can be measured and optimized.
Labor Management,"In 2021, 83% of filled VP, executive and board of directors positions included a female candidate at the full panel interview stage, and 92% included a BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) candidate."
Labor Management,"From there, the focus shifts to creating an inclusive and caring candidate experience that drives objective decision-making to block bias and select the most qualified candidate independent of representation."
Labor Management,"We sought multiple inputs to shape our definition of ""underrepresented candidates,"" including research from the National Science Foundation, Fast Company and other corporate entities, such as Adobe."
Labor Management,"n 2017, Recursion signed the Parity Pledge, which was a commitment to interview and consider at least one qualified woman and person of color for every open role, VP and higher."

Labor Management,"Additionally, our compensation framework and philosophy are designed to drive equitable decision-making throughout the employee experience."
Labor Management,"As a result, we have set an annual minimum base salary of $60,000 company-wide."
Labor Management,"Additionally, we leverage a construct of clearly defined development stages (Developing, Skilled, Expert) within each level in our job architecture."
Labor Management,"The analysis was designed to evaluate whether there was any evidence of systemic, class-based pay discrimination under applicable laws, and determine whether pay was equitable."
Labor Management,"The analysis found no material systemic pay differences between genders across our workforce; in fact, for all roles at Recursion where men and women are performing similar work, women earn $0.99 for every $1.00 earned by their male counterparts."
Labor Management,"We target +/- 2.5% equivalency with this measure to take into account noise inherent in a company of our size, and in some years this measure has shown slightly higher earnings for women compared to men."
Labor Management,"We launched monthly Inclusion Celebrations of underrepresented groups tied to broader societal celebrations, such as Black History Month in February, LGBTQIA+ Pride Month in June, and Native American Heritage Month in November."

Labor Management,"In addition to making progress toward our Racial Equity Commitment in 2021, we launched three new DEI Centers of Excellence during the year: Advancing Hispanics & Latinos, the Office of Asian & Pacific Islander Affairs and the Office of LGBT+ Affairs."
Labor Management,"We know there is more work to do, and we are committed to both continuing that work and to being transparent with our stakeholders about our progress."
Labor Management,"We recognize that our commitment to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive world starts with how we put that vision into practice inside our own company."
Labor Management,"We continue to deepen how we incorporate diversity into recruiting, training, developing and retaining our employees, and we are intentional about creating inclusive career pathways within our Firm (read more on page 30)."

Labor Management,"The audit began in January 2022, and we look forward to sharing the findings following its expected completion at the end of 2022."
Labor Management,We are committed to continue building a team that is inclusive and representative of our customers and clients.
Labor Management,"To make progress, we have been evolving the way we bring new colleagues into Citi, including accelerating the use of diverse slates in our recruiting and deepening our capabilities to measure our success."

Health and Safety,Toshiba Group overseas has established an appropriate system in accordance with the laws and OHSMS requirements of the country where the company is located.
Health and Safety,For Reference: Toshiba's Heritage of OHS Activities
Health and Safety,"The history of Toshiba's OHS activities goes back to the days of Toshiba's predecessor, Tokyo Electric. In 1914, Toshibumi Gamo, then chief of general affairs, witnessed a tragic electrocution accident, and thereafter dedicated his life to safety-related activities."
Health and Safety,"He became a central figure in Japan's safety movement, setting up the Association for Prioritization of Safety (Anzen Daiichi Kyokai) with Kakichi Uchida and others in 1917."
Health and Safety,"The green cross that is used on safety flags in Japan is said to originally be designed by Gamo, and have been used as a symbol in the National Safety Week."
Health and Safety,Toshiba Group has inherited this DNA and placed the top priority to employees' OHS.
Health and Safety,"Thanks to the efforts made over the years, Toshiba Group's domestic occupational accident incidence (accident frequency rate) has remained below the average of the manufacturing industry in Japan."
Health and Safety,Toshiba Group defines fatal accidents or accidents for which more than one person requires leave from work at the same time as serious accidents and strives to eliminate them.
Health and Safety,"Although Toshiba Group companies are engaged in a wide variety of industries, there are industries where the risk of a severe accident is relatively high, as judged from past cases."
Health and Safety,"We, therefore, identified target industries to introduce the international OHSMS standard based on third-party assessment and have been incorporating OHSAS 18001 and acquiring external certification for manufacturing companies in those industries since FY2007."
Health and Safety,"In FY2020, we transitioned to ISO 45001*1."
Health and Safety,"In FY2020, all manufacturing companies and 44 non-manufacturing companies (accounting for 75.1% of all personnel from Group companies in Japan) in Toshiba Group in Japan have acquired the certification."
Health and Safety,Information on Group companies overseas will be disclosed on the Sustainability website as soon as it is finalized.
Health and Safety,We visualize OHS management system by continuously evaluating and managing OHS risk through risk assessment based on OHSMS and ensuring legal compliance*2.
Health and Safety,"In addition, Group companies that fall outside the scope of ISO 45001 certificate acquisition also operate under an OHSMS in accordance with guidelines set by the industry or a simple PDCA cycle based on their respective OHS Management Policy and promotion plan."
Health and Safety,The corporate staff division is working to raise the level and make improvements to our OHSMS by regularly assessing the processes of our activities.
Health and Safety,"In general, the OHSMS operated by Toshiba Group companies in Japan covers employers (company) and employees (including dispatched workers and temporary workers) in accordance with the Industrial Safety and Health Act."
Health and Safety,We identify and assess the risks each subcontractor may face and inform them of these risks via an initial educational program for entry to the site.
Health and Safety,"We also share the measures we take through OHS Subcontractor Meetings, provide the opportunity for communication and coordination, and jointly implement emergency training."
Health and Safety,Evaluation and Control of Risks Associated with Safety and Health
Health and Safety,Identification and Risk Assessment of Hazards Related to Safety and Health
Health and Safety,Toshiba Group in Japan conducts two types of risk assessment (general OHS and chemical substance) based on guidelines concerning investigation into dangerous and harmful operations stipulated by the Japanese government.
Health and Safety,"This helps us to identify hazards*1, evaluate risk and formulate control measures*2 in the course of operating our OHSMS."
Health and Safety,"With this risk assessment, Toshiba Group employees strive to identify the hazards that may be encountered by them as well as subcontractors and visitors."
Health and Safety,"To ensure the effectiveness of our risk assessment, we provide training to OHS staff and risk assessors to enhance their capabilities."
Health and Safety,We also verify the validity of risk assessment findings through an annual review by members of the division which has the risk and auditing by the OHSMS Internal Audit department.
Health and Safety,"In addition, for anything designated as an emergency situation in the risk assessment, we have established response procedures and if required, regularly conduct evacuation drills that also include subcontractors in order to ensure smooth evacuation in the event of an emergency."
Health and Safety,"At Toshiba Group overseas, especially companies that have obtained OHSMS certification, we carry out risk assessment in accordance with the requirements of the standard and implement measures against extracted risks."
Health and Safety,"In the event of an occupational accident, Toshiba Group identifies the hazards and causes and assesses the risk prior to the accident and following the implementation of assumed measures to ensure that corrective measures are taken within the Group."
Health and Safety,We reflected our fundamental approach to mitigating the risk of natural disasters in Japan such as a large-scale earthquake or storm and flood damage in a Basic Guideline for Disaster Prevention Countermeasures and Business Continuity Pl an (BCP) for the Group.
Health and Safety,"The basic guideline prioritizes the life and personal safety of employees, and is based on the policy of protecting our social credibility, property and equipment, and fulfilling our corporate social responsibility to customers, shareholders and other stakeholders."
Health and Safety,"The guideline stipulates the role of Toshiba's corporate staff divisions, Toshiba Group companies and business sites in drafting and implementing policies and measures regarding disaster prevention and formulating a BCP so that each company and organization can prepare for disasters in accordance with their role."
Health and Safety,"In addition, we established Toshiba Group Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters, headed by the President and CEO of Toshiba, to coordinate with disaster response headquarters at Toshiba Group companies and business sites. This framework enables the coordination, direction and support of relief and recovery efforts."
Health and Safety,"To prepare for future disasters, we are also taking steps including creating regulations, introducing educational programs and conducting drills for employees, and stockpiling items and equipment required in a disaster."

Health and Safety,Toshiba Group seeks to prevent and avoid damage to parties and facilities related to our operations in countries and regions in addition to Japan as well as to prevent and avoid damage these parties and facilities may cause to third parties.
Health and Safety,"In the event of such a damage, we have established and operate a basic policy for safe operations overseas with the aim of minimizing the damage."
Health and Safety,"When implementing a new project, we confirm risks in advance as required through such means as risk assessments covering local laws and regulations, the surrounding environment, infrastructure, facilities, and substances used."
Health and Safety,"Prioritizing Life, Safety and Compliance in All Business Activities"
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group has set items related to health and safety (Toshiba Labor Agreement and work regulations in Japan), and when faced with life-threatening risk, employees are required to take the basic action of first reporting to their supervisor (or the administration division) and then following the instructions given. However, employees are permitted to prioritize evacuation in order to protect themselves when it is difficult to make a report in a timely manner."
Health and Safety,Employees will not be treated unfairly in such a case.
Health and Safety,Raising Awareness and Education on OHS
Health and Safety,Message from Top Management to All Employees for National OHS Weeks

Health and Safety,"In FY2020, we did not hold the conference with physical attendance to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Instead, we opened a special internal website, Sustainability Forum, to share information on awarded activities."
Health and Safety,We established regulations for OHS awards consisting of awards for OHS promotion and OHS improvement as well as OHS slogans with the aim of enhancing the Group's safety management and the three occupational health management* activities along with raising awareness of employees' participation in OHS activities.

Health and Safety,The frequency of occupational accidents (frequency of lost workdays) of Toshiba Group in Japan in FY2020 was almost the same as that of the previous fiscal year.
Health and Safety,"This is much lower than the national average for the manufacturing industry. The number of occupational accidents in FY2020 was 95 in total, almost unchanged from the previous fiscal year, with 31 cases resulting in lost workdays and 64 cases without lost workdays."
Health and Safety,The number of fatal accidents involving Toshiba Group employees over the past three years was zero in FY2018 and one in FY2019 (in Japan).
Health and Safety,"While no such accidents occurred in Japan in FY2020, as the number of fatal accidents outside Japan is still being calculated, it will be disclosed later on the Sustainability website."
Health and Safety,"The most common types of accidents were falling, reaction to motion/improper motion, caught in/between, and fall from height."
Health and Safety,"Of these, the accidents caused by normal activity of daily life (ex. falling while walking or falling downstairs), make up the majority at 32% of total accidents. In light of the number of accidents occurring from normal activities, we incorporated content aimed at preventing falls in addition to conventional health management information in our Company-wide e-learning program for FY2020, drawing attention to the need for vigilance among all Group employees."
Health and Safety,"The number of accidents where employees were caught in/between was roughly on par with standard years, but there was one fatality stemming from this in FY2019."
Health and Safety,"Therefore, we are working to share information throughout the Group on exactly what happened, the cause and our response to ensure that the same kind of accident does not happen again under similar conditions using similar equipment."
Health and Safety,"As for occupational accident prevention activities, Toshiba's corporate staff division has set objectives for promoting OHS of Toshiba Group."
Health and Safety,"Based on these objectives, each Group company and business site in Japan formulates promotion goals and plans while sharing their unique challenges, and undertakes actions aimed at preventing occupational accidents."
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group takes the fatal accident that occurred in FY2019 very seriously, and will place top priority on the reduction of hazardous risks that could lead to serious injuries and diseases and conduct a risk assessment of all workplaces and tasks with the aim of striving for zero serious accidents on an ongoing basis."
Health and Safety,"Based on the results of this risk assessment, we will review work methods to identify and eliminate risks, and systematically take necessary measures such as improving facilities and providing thorough training for employees to reduce and control such risks."
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group in Japan has set the prevention of lifestyle diseases, enhancement of mental health and prevention of overwork as the basis to achieve them as the top priority measures within the Toshiba Group's Standards for Health Management."
Health and Safety,We strive to raise employees' awareness of the importance of health and take various measures to maintain their physical and mental health from both a high-risk approach*1 and population approach*2.

Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group is engaged in many businesses and services that sustain society such as social infrastructure, the cornerstone of life."
Health and Safety,"In light of the need to fulfill our responsibilities to society and provide these businesses and services, we are continuing activities at sites engaged in manufacturing, services and distribution with appropriate measures in place to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection."
Health and Safety,"In response to the pandemic, the COVID Countermeasures Headquarters was established to manage the situation within Toshiba Group and provide information on measures based on the latest trends and knowledge through internal notices and a dedicated website."
Health and Safety,We made a decision that in principle employees were to work from home where possible and set a target attendance rate for each job type for workplaces where working from home is viable.
Health and Safety,"To support this policy, we increased the number of lines enabling access to our internal systems."
Health and Safety,"In line with the rapid rise in the proportion of people working from home, we have strived to inform people of websites containing information about exercise and other ways to alleviate stress, which were most often requested, as well as establishing an online health consultation system run by occupational healthcare staff."
Health and Safety,"For employees that need to go into work, we have made it mandatory to measure body temperature, report to supervisors and wear a face mask to prevent infection."
Health and Safety,"For employees stranded overseas due to border restrictions, we conduct health-related surveys to confirm employees have access to medication they need and provide necessary support."
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group in Japan has held the OHS Management Conference on a regular basis since FY2019 to share the Group's health-related issues and regular monitoring indicators, or key performance indicators (KPIs), and the top management of each key Group company in attendance are then requested to incorporate those into measures to improve the safety and health management of their employees though the governance line."
Health and Safety,"As for the system for implementation, the function of providing support in the area of occupational healthcare had been provided by a separate company from FY2002, with related services provided based on a contract with each Group company."
Health and Safety,"In light of the increasing importance of health management under OHS management, however, this system was discontinued in November 2019 and now an occupational healthcare officer is sent to business sites and placed under the direct control of management there (excluding certain companies that employ such officers directly) ."
Health and Safety,This new system enables more tailored and flexible health services to be deployed in line with the challenges facing each business site.
Health and Safety,"In addition, we launched the Collabo-Health Meeting and started convening meetings in FY2019 together with the Toshiba Health Insurance Association, to study how to promote health measures throughout the Toshiba Group in Japan organically."
Health and Safety,This meeting aims to accelerate OHS management and enhance health at the various life stages of employees in addition to realizing the Company's objectives of enhancing corporate value and ensuring a bright and vibrant life for our employees.
Health and Safety,It is also designed to help achieve the social missions and goals of the Toshiba Health Insurance Association such as optimizing medical expenses.
Health and Safety,KPIs for health management were set forth as shown below at the OHS Management Conference for FY2019.
Health and Safety,We will aim to further improve items which have already attained nationwide target figures and raise the level of items which are yet to achieve targets nationwide.
Health and Safety,"Our varied approach will center on improving the process indicator, lifestyle habits."
Health and Safety,High blood pressure requiring more than normal consideration
Health and Safety,High blood sugar requiring more than normal consideration
Health and Safety,"As a high-risk approach to preventing lifestyle-related diseases, Toshiba Group in Japan has steadily provided priority support to employees at high risk of developing brain and heart diseases, through such means as work management and health guidance, according to work classification determined based on levels of regular medical checkup data, a shared standard across all Group companies since FY2011."
Health and Safety,We also run a program to prevent diabetes from becoming severe in collaboration with the Toshiba Health Insurance Association.
Health and Safety,The effects of these initiatives have started to emerge with a decrease in the percentage of deaths caused by brain and heart disease while still at work and a decrease in people at high risk of high blood pressure and high blood sugar. (Refer to Toshiba Group KPIs)
Health and Safety,"As a population approach, we have set target values for improving lifestyle habits and have been undertaking measures such as anti-smoking measures, improvements to the canteen menu and providing opportunity to exercise, since FY2013."
Health and Safety,"We introduced a health-related education program for each age group in FY2014 and have been supporting employees to maintain their health according to their stage of life. As a result, numerous lifestyle indices, including levels of smoking and walking, are improving."
Health and Safety,"There is still the need for measures to make further improvements by setting KPIs, however."
Health and Safety,"In particular, the percentage of patients and those having a high risk of contracting metabolic syndrome (visceral fat syndrome) is on the rise nationwide, and this is a shared issue throughout Toshiba Group."
Health and Safety,"In addition to improving patients and those having a high risk, we aim to prevent others from having the metabolic syndrome by providing specified health guidance led by the Toshiba Health Insurance Association and implementing measures to enhance health guidance as a company."
Health and Safety,Examples of initiatives to improve eating habits
Health and Safety,"At the Smart Community Center in Kawasaki, the cafeteria displays the amount of calories contained in food on digital signage and automatic cash registers, and industrial healthcare professionals issue health-related newsletters."
Health and Safety,"In addition, at Keihin Product Operations, we distribute pocket health cards to employees who tend to eat food from convenience stores during business trips to encourage them to choose more well-balanced meals."
Health and Safety,"At Toshiba Fuchu Complex, we devised a special stretching routine to help prevent locomotive syndrome and accidents that involve falling over and built it into workplace exercises."
Health and Safety,We are working on promoting health together with the community and in cooperation with Fuchu City in Tokyo.
Health and Safety,"Since FY2020, the Headquarters business site created an original exercise called Mina-tore, which is named by combining Mina (meaning everyone in Japanese), Minato-ku, where the Headquarters is located, and ""tore"" (meaning training in Japanese), and has released a video for employees."
Health and Safety,"At Keihin Product Operations, we have resumed fitness tests that had been stopped temporarily with the aim of getting all employees involved in activities to enhance their health."
Health and Safety,We are also conducting a course that gives advice on how to make improvements based on the test results.
Health and Safety,We have been taking various anti-smoking measures based on smoking separation systems according to the circumstance of each business site.
Health and Safety,"Smoking rates tend to be higher than the national average, particularly at manufacturing sites."
Health and Safety,"In FY2019, it was decided at the OHS Management Conference that smoking was not allowed during work hours and that indoor smoking areas would be abolished as a general rule at Toshiba Group in Japan."
Health and Safety,This message was also conveyed by top management during National Occupational Health Week and in our in-house communication magazine.
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group is undertaking anti-smoking campaigns at business sites that make use of the subsidy system offered by the Toshiba Health Insurance Association, and No Smoking has been enforced during work hours since January 2020."
Health and Safety,"At the OHS Management Conference in FY2020, it was decided that all smoking areas left for use during break-times should be removed by the end of FY2021."
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group will take further actions for smoking cessation from the perspective of health management, including supporting smokers to quit smoking."
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group in Japan was one of the first Japanese companies to address the issue of employees' mental health and has developed an advanced, comprehensive system in four areas of care to support our employees' work and daily life."
Health and Safety,"Going forward, we will encourage each individual to consciously maintain their physical and mental well-being, keeping in mind work styles that are now the new normal."
Health and Safety,Mental health awareness-raising and educational activities
Health and Safety,"In addition to the intranet, a PR magazine Kenpo Information published by the Toshiba Health Insurance Association is one of the tools to promote awareness and education about mental health."
Health and Safety,We also provide e-learning on self-care for Group companies in Japan every year to support employees to self-develop a healthy mind.
Health and Safety,"In FY2020, 67,154 people from Group companies in Japan received the course, marking a 98.5% participation rate."
Health and Safety,We also distribute materials to employees at manufacturing sites who are unable to take e-learning courses and strive to ensure that all employees of Toshiba Group complete the program.
Health and Safety,Stress checks to build awareness and help with coping
Health and Safety,Toshiba Group carries out stress checks with the main aim of getting each employee to recognize and deal with their stress.
Health and Safety,We have created a unique system linked to our medical checkup system and made it mandatory for employees to undergo stress checks at business sites with fewer than 50 workers in FY2018.
Health and Safety,"By doing so, we are promoting stress checks throughout the Group."
Health and Safety,"As a result of timely follow-up, Group-wide participation rate is higher than the national average (90.2% for FY2020)."
Health and Safety,"All employees whose stress check score exceeds set criteria are asked if they would like to receive consultation, and those interested receive advice on how to better deal with stress."
Health and Safety,"Managers are informed through educational programs, messages from top management and other means about the importance of paying attention to their workers and talking to them in order to detect any unusual signs that imply poor mental health."
Health and Safety,"In order to raise health and safety awareness at each workplace and in each team, we have been promoting communication by holding workplace meetings."
Health and Safety,"Since 1977, Toshiba began training managers as listeners, and has implemented mental health education for managerial ranks in response to the trend of the times."
Health and Safety,"At present, management at each business site can take workplace care seminars at the time of promotion as well as courses on mental health-related topics at the in-house training center."
Health and Safety,Feedback of workplace stress check charts to managers (stress check)
Health and Safety,Stress checks are conducted in organizations with more than 10 employees within a Group company.
Health and Safety,We provide feedback on these stress checks to managers (and other workers in positions of authority) in the form of a workplace stress check chart that shows the relative stress levels of employees in the organization*.
Health and Safety,These charts serve as sources of ideas for managers on how to make improvements in the workplace.
Health and Safety,Each manager then implements the improvement measures with the support of industrial healthcare professionals and the administration division if required.
Health and Safety,Five years have passed since the system started and a number of excellent improvement practices have been accumulated.
Health and Safety,"By sharing such measures at each Group company, we aim to enhance the level of stress management throughout the entire Toshiba Group in Japan."
Health and Safety,Care by Industrial Healthcare Professionals at Business Sites
Health and Safety,"Industrial healthcare professionals (including industrial physicians, public healthcare nurses and professional psychologists) offer support for the independent self-care (primary prevention) of employees through various interviews (providing measures to follow-up medical examinations, discussions with employees working excessive overtime, etc.) and by providing opportunities for consultation."
Health and Safety,"As a coordinator, they work to promote early detection and treatment of employees suffering mental health issues (secondary prevention) and smooth return to work and recurrence prevention for those who have taken leave (tertiary prevention) in cooperation with the workplace, the administration division, households and medical institutions, as required."
Health and Safety,Toshiba Group was one of the first companies in Japan to start a return-to-work support program in FY2003 with the aim of ensuring appropriate tertiary prevention for persons who have taken leave for mental illness reasons.
Health and Safety,The program was revised in FY2011 to ensure that employees make a smooth return to work after taking leave and do not suffer a relapse.
Health and Safety,"Industrial healthcare professionals coordinate with the employee's doctor, workplace members and family to devise appropriate working hours, place and job style."
Health and Safety,"[For reference] Enhancing the skills, etc. of industrial physicians and occupational healthcare staff"
Health and Safety,"We provide regular education (upon joining the Company, after three months, specialized programs, etc.) and hold regular meetings (conferences for industrial physicians <twice a year>, etc.) with the aim of improving the skills of industrial physicians and occupational healthcare staff, which includes handling consultation."
Health and Safety,The Group continuously seeks to brush up knowledge and share safety and health measures throughout Toshiba Group.
Health and Safety,"Considering the fact that health-related information is sensitive personal information, each Group company and business site has established the Health Information Handling Regulations ."
Health and Safety,Industrial healthcare professionals and other related personnel in each Group company take care in the handling of health-related information of employees that they learn in the course of their work.
Health and Safety,Use of Other Resources to Provide Employee Care
Health and Safety,Industrial healthcare professionals at each business site play a central role in building a network with local external medical institutions and return-to-work facilities to make sure employees in need of treatment receive the appropriate medical care.
Health and Safety,hose sites that are small in scale and do not have resident industrial healthcare professionals liaise with the local occupational health support center to supplement the care otherwise provided by industrial healthcare professionals.
Health and Safety,"Company-wide, we disseminate information regarding the different consulting services established to meet the circumstances and environment of the person needing advice through various media such as self-care e-learning material, corporate and in-house health insurance association newsletters and our website."
Health and Safety,Toshiba Group was one of the first companies in Japan to introduce an outside Employee Assistance Program (EAP) in 2000.
Health and Safety,The program has now been taken over by a mental and physical health consultation service that is offered 24 hours a day and is run jointly by the Toshiba Health Insurance Association and Toshiba.
Health and Safety,"The service covers such areas as mental and physical health problems, childcare and nursing care provided by telephone, email or in-person counseling, while ensuring privacy."
Health and Safety,"The long-standing service is available to employees as well as their families, and quite a few inquiries have been made."
Health and Safety,"While the first principle of Toshiba Group in Japan is to transition to a working style in which employees are not expected to do overtime (work style reform), the Group has also been working to prevent health problems caused by overtime work since before the revision to the Industrial Safety and Health Act in 2006."
Health and Safety,"For example, employees who work 80 hours or more overtime per month are required to receive health guidance from industrial physicians (interview guidance for employees working excessive overtime)."
Health and Safety,This standard sufficiently meets the requirements of the revised Industrial Safety and Health Regulations enforced in April 2019.
Health and Safety,Toshiba Group in Japan has a specialized division to support the health management of employees who work overseas.
Health and Safety,"In addition to medical checkups prior to the posting and upon return in accordance with the law, we have made it compulsory to have a checkup once a year while away, including for the employee's family."
Health and Safety,We are taking steps to ensure employees stationed overseas receive the same level of health management support as our employees in Japan based on the results of each individual's medical checkups.
Health and Safety,The services include providing employees and their family members with optimal support in line with each county's medical care system such as consultation and information on local medical institutions and arranging emergency transport.
Health and Safety,"We are taking a flexible approach to medical checks for employees who work overseas amid the COVID-19 pandemic (FY2020 and possibly beyond) with the understanding that checkups will be administered as soon as the situation improves in consideration of difficulty traveling between countries, conditions of local medical services and the risk of infection."
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group compiles the latest information gathered from various sources that include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, companies specializing in safety crisis management overseas and international medical care, international risk-related media and in the field concerning outbreaks of infectious diseases in foreign countries and their spread, and distributes it to those stationed in relevant countries in order to alert them on such risks."
Health and Safety,"Toshiba Group in Japan also gives guidance to employees assigned to work overseas and their accompanying families, on medical, safety, infectious disease measures and other information on life overseas."
Health and Safety,"Once overseas assignment is confirmed, a briefing is held, including prior medical checkups and shots of vaccination."
Health and Safety,New recruits in Japan are provided with booklets containing information about HIV/AIDS.
Health and Safety,"Along with other awareness-raising programs covering topics such as the prevention of HIV infection, the Group calls for the prohibition of unfair discrimination due to insufficient knowledge about the disease."
Health and Safety,"In addition, business sites cooperate with the government for rubella antibody tests for target age groups by providing the venue of medical examination."
Health and Safety,"As a result of our health-related efforts, we were selected by Nippon Kenko Kaigi* as the 2021 Certified Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program; namely, Toshiba and its key Group companies (excluding Toshiba Tec Corporation), Toshiba Lighting & Technology Corporation, Toshiba Carrier Corporation and its two group companies, Toshiba IT & Control Systems Corporation, and Toshiba Plant Systems & Services Corporation (Large enterprise category) as well as Toshiba Precision Corporation (Small- and medium-sized enterprise category)."

Health and Safety,"This hybrid model provides a competitive advantage that allows the Company to bring innovations to market faster while maintaining strong control over product development, supply chain operations, and ESG impacts."
Health and Safety,This model also provides a means to tailor its global manufacturing operations and products to regional markets.
Health and Safety,"The Company's global manufacturing locations are ISO 9001:2015 (Quality), ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental), and ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health and Safety) (OHS) certified."
Health and Safety,"As required by these internationally accepted standards, the management systems that incorporate objectives and targets at each certified facility continually foster a safe and healthy work environment for employees."

Health and Safety,"Moreover, the OHS Management System is integrated with the organization's strategy and operations and assimilates health and safety programs throughout the Company's global manufacturing footprint."
Health and Safety,"This is accomplished through a process of planning, education, prevention, controls, performance evaluation, and continuous improvement which are vital to achieving the Company's objectives."
Health and Safety,"Each manufacturing and development facility reports the number of industrial injuries, illnesses, and lost days each month to the Global OHS Team as part of their KPIs."
Health and Safety,"In FY 2020/21 there were no fatalities, work-related injuries, or major accidents, and the Company's recordable work-related injury rate of 0.047 exceeded its target of 0.27, and its lost-day injury rate of 0.032 surpassed its target of 0.18."
Health and Safety,More information is available in the Consolidated Metrics section of this report.
Health and Safety,The Company has implemented a mature hazard and risk identification program that assesses the daily activities and projects throughout its operations and enables the prevention of new hazards while minimizing risks in the workplace.
Health and Safety,This practice helps to determine if additional health and safety measures are needed as a precaution.
Health and Safety,"For example, the assessment is administered when there are significant changes in the workplace, including changes to workshop layout, new equipment installation, or other compliance-related changes. The Company's hazard identification award program is an effective way to engage employees and encourage participation in health and safety management while helping employees recognize potential risks or hazards in their daily work environment."
Health and Safety,"Through this and other programs, the Company can increase awareness and implement a sense of ownership as it maintains a safe workplace for everyone."
Health and Safety,"The Company strives to maintain a workplace that is accident or injury-free. When a work-related injury, illness, or near-miss incident occurs, facility managers and the OHS team immediately launch an investigation of the incident, analyze the root cause, formulate corrective action plans, and track the activities to closure."
Health and Safety,The 'Lessons Learned' process includes the sharing of information and data analysis with other manufacturing locations and the distribution of a Safety Bulletin Alert which reduces repeated incidents and supports continuous improvement.
Health and Safety,"The Company embraces a ""People First"" philosophy and values a healthy and safe culture."
Health and Safety,"Employee participation is essential to the success of OHS management, thus it enforces processes and develops online tools to support employee awareness through appropriate training and site-specific safety information."
Health and Safety,"The Safety Committee that supports its manufacturing and selected field locations conducts regularly scheduled discussions on a variety of safety issues, allowing all members to participate in the Company's corrective action process."
Health and Safety,"In addition to the education and training designed to meet regulatory requirements, the Company's manufacturing sites promote the Annual Health and Safety Week or Month to further reinforce awareness."
Health and Safety,"Occupational Health and Safety standards are incorporated at the earliest stage in the life cycle of a facility, including the equipment, the planning phase, and non-routine tasks and projects."
Health and Safety,Last year the OHS team published a comprehensive guidebook titled 'Prevention through Design' to assist each location with the design criteria for safety precautions at the very beginning of new equipment installations.
Health and Safety,"The Company also implemented safety controls related to purchased goods, equipment, and services, and digital safety-related controls for contractors and visitors in the workplace."
Health and Safety,"This proactive approach helps to prevent work-related injuries, ill health, and fatalities."
Health and Safety,The Company recognizes the importance of developing and implementing an emergency plan that protects people involved in its manufacturing processes.
Health and Safety,The Company's ensures that employees are familiar with its emergency response procedures and processes.

Health and Safety,The Company is dedicated to ensuring that its manufacturing locations and supply chain enforce the following:
Health and Safety,"During FY 2020/21, six manufacturing sites underwent audits through the RBA Validated Audit Program (VAP)."
Health and Safety,"Five sites achieved Silver Level, one site achieved Platinum Level, and two sites received the Factory of Choice (FOC) award."
Health and Safety,"Due to the COVID-19 impact, the RBA VAP audit for the Company's Pondicherry, India location was postponed until FY 2021/22."
Health and Safety,"The Company's FY 2021/22 target is to achieve successful RBA VAP audits for the remaining five locations, and to receive the FOC award for the remaining sites in FY 2022/23."
Health and Safety,Plans are in progress to have independent third-party RBA audits performed at all manufacturing locations.
Health and Safety,"When this plan is achieved, its in-house manufacturing network will reach 100% RBA VAP enforcement."
Health and Safety,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Company deployed an immediate plan to support the health and safety of employees."

Health and Safety,"Injury, illness or fatality can influence operational readiness and generate reputational damage, which can impact our financial and business performance."
Health and Safety,Dufry's own health and safety regulations are applied on top of the location specific ones and include group-wide regulations and guidelines.
Health and Safety,In the context of the COVID-pandemic Dufry implemented an additional Global Health&Safety Protocol to protect both employees and customers.
Health and Safety,A detailed description of the Health&Safety management process is described on pages 99-100 of the ESG Report.
Health and Safety,0 marine casualties.
Health and Safety,Lost Time Incident Frequency below 0.5 by 2030.
Health and Safety,The following set of principles guides all our efforts to protect and improve employee health and safety and preserve our environment.
Health and Safety,We aim to:
Health and Safety,"Meet or exceed applicable environmental, health and safety (EH&S) requirements and verify performance through periodic audits."
Health and Safety,"Utilize our own EH&S standards that provide safeguards for the community, the workplace and the environment while also providing flexibility to meet the needs of our business."
Health and Safety,"We do this by emphasizing individual responsibility for safety by all employees, with support at all levels of management."
Health and Safety,"Communicate EH&S policies, programs and issues to Rogers employees and stakeholders."
Health and Safety,"Install, manage and operate our manufacturing processes to maximize workplace safety, conserve natural resources and protect the environment."
Health and Safety,Ensure all employees are aware of their critical roles and responsibilities in fulfilling the objectives of Rogers' Environmental Health and Safety Policy.
Health and Safety,Motivate all employees to become personally engaged in health and safety activities.
Health and Safety,"Due to the COVID-19 crisis, on March 12, 2020, we moved to a global required work from home policy for employees who were able to perform their job remotely."
Health and Safety,"For employees whose work required them to be onsite, we took appropriate measures - as recommended by leading public health authorities - to ensure that the work environment was safe and the risk of the virus spreading in our facilities was reduced as much as possible."
Health and Safety,"In the U.S. and India, we provided resources to employees and their dependents for immediate COVID-19 testing on campus, held large-scale vaccination events on campus and provided quarantine support."
Health and Safety,"However, we heard that many employees also missed connecting in-person with their colleagues and teams."
Health and Safety,"As we planned our return to campus and our work model for the future, we focused on creating a global framework that provides flexibility while maintaining our strong culture of innovation, collaboration, openness and camaraderie - serving current employees and helping to attract future talent."
Health and Safety,We took a carefully planned phased approach to welcoming employees back to the office in 2021.
Health and Safety,"As of July 2021, employees can work onsite as many days as they choose, provided they comply with all onsite safety protocols and requirements."
Health and Safety,The safety of our employees and customers is a core value.
Health and Safety,"S-W Cares is the Company's enterprise-wide initiative to communicate our approach to occupational health and safety and serves as a roadmap for achieving environmental, health and safety (EHS) excellence across the Company."
Health and Safety,"It provides a leadership governance structure built around a common language that is supported by tools to continuously track and measure our efforts to ensure safe workplaces, protect the environment and meet or exceed regulatory requirements."
Health and Safety,"We have formal systems to help employees ""find, own, fix and report"" workplace EHS hazards before they lead to an incident."
Health and Safety,"Every manufacturing site has developed a safety action plan, and monthly trainings are conducted to reinforce specific focus areas and ensure the implementation of best practices."
Health and Safety,Employees then use what they have learned to audit their personal workspace for potential issues.
Health and Safety,"With the launch of the TLC Stay Safe Out There campaign in late 2019, the Company continued to focus on reducing the number of injuries attributable to Trips, Lifts and Cuts in our stores and facilities across the globe."
Health and Safety,These types of hazards typically account for 85% of the Company's employee-reported injuries.
Health and Safety,The initiative also brings awareness to the risk of fires and spills at manufacturing locations.
Health and Safety,"According to Sherwin-Williams Safety Director Paul Chantler, the Company saw an injury reduction of 18% in 2020 (compared with 2019)."
Health and Safety,"With the TLC campaign in place, the Company reduced its recordable case rate (RCR) in one year by the same amount as in the previous three years combined."
Health and Safety,"""The TLC campaign encourages employees to take a personal stake in the safety of their workplace,"" Chantler said."
Health and Safety,"""For all of Sherwin-Williams, we saw an RCR reduction from 1.30 to 1.06, with cuts, contacts and lifting injuries seeing the biggest reductions."""
Health and Safety,"For The Americas Group, the RCR fell from 1.84 to 1.34 - a decrease of more than 27%, while Global Supply Chain reduced its RCR by 6% from 1.03 to 0.97."
Health and Safety,"Companywide, trips and falls were reduced by 4%, while lift incidents saw a reduction of 16% and contact injuries were reduced by an impressive 33%."
Health and Safety,"""This was a great Company consolidated effort, helping to make it fun and foster better relationships with our other facilities,"" said Shane Shifflet, Sherwin-Williams Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Manager at the Garland, Texas Plant."
Health and Safety,"Throughout the year, global sites incorporated the messaging into daily and monthly safety meetings and engaged employees in creative ways to spread the word."
Health and Safety,"Employees organized poster contests, designed original safety memes and more throughout the year."
Health and Safety,"Sherwin-Williams Quito, Ecuador Plant EHS Manager Santiago Oña was impressed with how the campaign encouraged employees to ""take on the challenge"" by providing standards and recommendations in an easily understood manner."
Health and Safety,"For Candice Aliasgar-Sankoomar, Sherwin-Williams EHS Manager in Deeside, United Kingdom, the initiative is just another great example of S-W Cares - the Company's enterprise-wide product stewardship and EHS excellence program promoting responsible operations, employee safety and a healthy planet."
Health and Safety,"Sherwin-Williams is committed to providing a safe working environment for all,"" Aliasgar-Sankoomar said."
Health and Safety,"The focus on trips, lifts, cuts, fires and spills was a unique initiative that provided a roadmap with universal tools to raise awareness."
Health and Safety,The TLC campaign is a reminder that safety is a core value.
Health and Safety,I believe it was successful because it was specific and targeted.
Health and Safety,It narrowed the focus on safety and provided tools to move the needle in a more efficient way.
Health and Safety,"In 2020, we achieved a company record, with a recordable case rate of 1.06. (Recordable case rate is defined as total number of employees with recordable incidents per 200,000 hours worked."
Health and Safety,Our EHS Management System covers all Sherwin-Williams facilities.
Health and Safety,"Each of our three operating segments - The Americas Group (TAG), Consumer Brands Group (CBG) and Performance Coatings Group (PCG) - and our Global Supply Chain division within CBG manage EHS through the S-W Cares initiative, but tailor their approach to their specific risk profile."
Health and Safety,"Through the creation of a tactical EHS handbook and companion mobile app personalized for the unique operations of TAG in 2020, we have been able to broadly standardize and communicate our expectations on the sales floor in our company-operated stores."
Health and Safety,We are enhancing safety leadership by adding an EHS leader to each of our five TAG divisions to support and oversee ongoing efforts.
Health and Safety,"The introduction of the mobile app has improved the efficiency of completing inspections, increased visibility of the results and streamlined EHS data collection."
Health and Safety,"That, however, is expected to change by the end of 2021 with the implementation of a comprehensive, simplified management system that will drive efficiencies and increase transparency."
Health and Safety,"The new system will include known international EHS management system requirements, as well as resources pertaining to all Company initiatives."
Health and Safety,Our EHS practices and procedures are governed by an executive steering committee that includes representatives from our three segments as well as our Global Supply Chain division.
Health and Safety,"It also functions as a think tank, allowing divisions to share learnings and leverage improvements."
Health and Safety,"While each business line operates autonomously, collaboration between divisions about EHS topics has dramatically increased and helped drive company-wide improvements."
Health and Safety,"Our approach to occupational health and safety includes the following three focus areas: Process Safety, Safety & Risk and Occupational Health."
Health and Safety,"As we continually strive to achieve zero recordable injuries, we have set ambitious aspirational goals we are targeting to accomplish by 2025:"
Health and Safety,Safety & Risk: Achieve a recordable cases rate (RCR) of 0.8
Health and Safety,Occupational Health: Reduce the number of ergonomic injuries by implementing two interventions per year in each manufacturing site
Health and Safety,"Each year, Sherwin-Williams drivers traverse millions of miles to bring paint and coatings from manufacturing and distribution centers to our stores and, ultimately, to customers."
Health and Safety,"In 2020, our Global Supply Chain (GSC) Distribution Fleet recorded the lowest Department of Transportation (DOT) reportable accidents per million miles in more than five years."
Health and Safety,The Distribution Fleet reportable accidents per million miles is significantly below the 2020 industry benchmark of 0.54
Health and Safety,"Within the GSC division, Company leadership has encouraged the Driver Safety Committee to highlight issues and provide solutions."
Health and Safety,At least one driver represents each distribution center on the committee
Health and Safety,"A key improvement for the Distribution Fleet was the rollout of a wireless camera system, offering drivers additional vantage points."
Health and Safety,"""Eliminating blind spots, whenever possible, is key, and these camera systems have allowed for safer maneuvering,"" said David Phillips, Sherwin-Williams Senior Director, Logistics & Fleet Operations."
Health and Safety,The Americas Group (TAG) also continues to see a downward trend in DOT-reportable accidents.
Health and Safety,"Most recently, our TAG fleet ranked in the 87th percentile for commercial carriers similar in fleet size by the U.S."
Health and Safety,DOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.
Health and Safety,"Additionally, TAG's commercial and non-commercial fleets saw a reduction of preventable accidents in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting in more than $814,000 in savings."
Health and Safety,"Across both fleets, offering support to new team members was a focus."
Health and Safety,"There are now 18 Driver Training & Support Specialists (DTSS) who onboard new delivery drivers, complete quarterly safety trainings/compliance audits and participate in annual ride-alongs."
Health and Safety,It is important for newly hired drivers to receive hands-on safety training from the beginning.
Health and Safety,The DTSS have helped reduce the number of preventable accidents and improve the Company's DOT CSA safety rating by championing a culture of safety.
Health and Safety,GSC lowered the number of accidents among drivers by reassessing the tools and information available to new drivers.
Health and Safety,"Always looking for opportunities to build upon strong safety processes, the team is continuously exploring new systems for logging and gathering insights that allow for positive and coachable feedback to be provided to our drivers."
Health and Safety,"From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Sherwin-Williams responded swiftly and decisively to protect our employees, customers and partners."
Health and Safety,"Our crisis response team was activated and began producing daily updates and developed COVID-19-specific safety protocols, as well as travel guidelines."
Health and Safety,"A COVID-19 task force was assembled to establish protocols based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies that aligned with national, federal, state, provincial and local public health orders and recommendations."
Health and Safety,"This included, but was not limited to, the use of face coverings, enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures and the implementation of social distancing measures."
Health and Safety,"As the supply of hand sanitizer became scarce in supply and generally unavailable, we adapted by manufacturing our own hand sanitizer for distribution to employees."
Health and Safety,"The task force also developed other protocols that included enhanced employee safety protocols, contact tracing, and work-from-home and return-to-workplace measures."
Health and Safety,"The policies, which were updated as needed to reflect evolving situations, were collaboratively reviewed by EHS, human resources, operations and store leaders to ensure appropriateness and consistency before being communicated to all stakeholders."
Health and Safety,"In response to the pandemic and actions taken by public health and governmental authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we temporarily reduced store hours and closed the sales floors of our more than 4,700 store locations."
Health and Safety,"To continue meeting customer needs, we quickly and simultaneously pivoted to requiring customers to order product online or via phone and retrieve purchases via curbside pickup or delivery."
Health and Safety,Curbside service remains available today.
Health and Safety,"Welcoming customers back inside our stores was another noteworthy collaborative effort, as employees worked together to comply with new safety protocols."
Health and Safety,Strong safety practices and training are integrated throughout our company.
Health and Safety,"Following the introduction of new measures to heighten awareness of the importance of safety, we have seen a 19% reduction in workplace injury claims over the past four years."
Health and Safety,We take team member engagement very seriously.
Health and Safety,"Our leading ""people"" metric across our organization is team member engagement, which is scored across various areas, including overall job satisfaction, whether the team member would recommend us as a place to work, personal commitment, being energized at work and intent to remain employed."
Health and Safety,Team member engagement is crucial to customer satisfaction and the satisfaction of our NPPs and their donors.
Health and Safety,"Through Wyndham Hotels & Resorts' brand programs, the Company remains committed to the health and wellness of our guests and team members."

Health and Safety,"Overall, our management system is based on the following principles:"
Health and Safety,Dow's health and safety processes meet or exceed the requirements of the countries in which we operate.
Health and Safety,"All Dow locations are expected to comply with Dow or local requirements, whichever are more stringent."
Health and Safety,"The management system has been externally assessed and found to meet ISO-14001, ISO-9001 and Responsible Care® code requirements."
Health and Safety,The system applies globally to all Dow premises and joint venture locations where we have greater than 50% ownership.
Health and Safety,"Our management system covers Dow workers regardless of whether they are working on or off Dow premises, and all contracted workers performing work on Dow premises."
Health and Safety,"Workers who deliver materials (e.g., package delivery services) are excluded from our full management system but receive fundamental training if entering our sites."
Health and Safety,"The management system is designed and implemented by professionals employed or contracted by Dow (e.g., Health Services, Industrial Hygiene, and Environment, Health & Safety Delivery)."
Health and Safety,"Aligned with the global management system, every work group at Dow must establish site- and unit-specific procedures that assure full implementation of our standards and compliance with local regulations."
Health and Safety,"Required self-assessments and independent internal audits monitor compliance and identify best practices, with audit results reviewed by Dow management, including a cross-functional team composed of all business presidents, the senior leader for EH&S, the head of auditing, the chief financial officer and the Board of directors' Environment, Health, Safety & Technology committee."

Health and Safety,They also positively recognize coworkers making safe choices.
Health and Safety,Retaliation against anyone who raises or reports concerns about workplace safety is prohibited under Dow's Code of Conduct.
Health and Safety,ApolloTM Root Cause Investigation methodology is used for all recordable injuries and near-miss situations where potential existed for a life-impacting injury.
Health and Safety,"Consistent use of the methodology ensures we understand the cause and take corrective actions at the point of the problem, as well as at the strategy and management system levels."
Health and Safety,Significant learnings are shared globally through our Learning Experience Report process.
Health and Safety,"Once hazards are identified, we determine feasible and effective solutions."
Health and Safety,A tragic loss of life in 2019 triggered a global response and resulted in enacting changes in 2020 to our management system for heavy equipment and moving vehicles.
Health and Safety,The management system update requires implementation of a hierarchy of controls to prevent accidents related to heavy equipment and reversing moving vehicles.
Health and Safety,"With more than a century of experience in occupational health, Dow is committed to worker health protection."
Health and Safety,"We have honed an effective, systematic approach to Total Worker Health® that comprehensively controls workplace health risks, protects workers and improves the health of Dow people."
Health and Safety,We engage local EH&S operations personnel to help identify workers at potential risk.
Health and Safety,Worker health hazards are considered as part of the risk review process for new products and changes in the manufacture of current products.
Health and Safety,We use a hierarchy of controls to mitigate worker health risks.
Health and Safety,Industrial hygiene guidelines drive use of engineering controls and appropriate personal protective equipment.
Health and Safety,"Travel health services (e.g., counseling, vaccinations and access to local care) reduce risk for endemic or acute health problems while on business."
Health and Safety,"In addition to traditional occupational health risks, we minimize other workplace health risks through fitness for duty, workplace tobacco and substance-use policies, and a fatigue management strategy."
Health and Safety,Employees who work in areas with high-risk occupational hazards are monitored medically and tracked through our health records system.
Health and Safety,"All workers are provided baseline and periodic medical surveillance, testing, evaluation and health counseling to identify and control work-related health problems."
Health and Safety,We use the same rigorous standards globally.
Health and Safety,"Health results are carefully monitored through health trend summaries and, when needed, through directed health epidemiology studies."
Health and Safety,"We track health-related recordable injury and illness cases (e.g., results from potential exposure to chemical, physical or biological substances, or ergonomic workplace stressors), with annual improvement targets."
Health and Safety,"Like other environment, health and safety standards, occupational health requirements are global and meet or exceed local regulations."
Health and Safety,"Every Dow employee has access to occupational services at no cost through an on-site, company managed clinic or an off-site provider managed by Dow Occupational Health."
Health and Safety,"In 2020, we had 58 clinic locations."
Health and Safety,"Clinical treatment is available to all employees for work-related injury or illness, and employees can access occupational health care on paid worktime."
Health and Safety,Our commitment to worker health is not limited to occupational health risks.
Health and Safety,"We began a comprehensive wellness program more than 30 years ago because we recognized the value of good health to our employees, their families and our communities."
Health and Safety,"Dow's well-being strategy is framed across four dimensions - physical, mental, community and financial well-being - for an approach that is holistic, global, employee centered and outcome-driven."
Health and Safety,"Engagement is not limited to members of the Human Resources and Occupational Health functions - it benefits from passionate involvement by Employee Resource Groups, Employee Experience champions and Dow's Inclusion and Diversity team."
Health and Safety,"Our well-being objective is that 100% of Dow employees are their best self for work, home and play."
Health and Safety,Here's a look at a few ways we support employee well-being.
Health and Safety,"We track each site's alignment with evidence-based well-being strategies and best practices, including access to healthy foods, relaxation spaces, lactation support, peer and leader support for mental health and resiliency, and access to physical activity."
Health and Safety,"EAP is available to all employees and their families globally for help with general stress, substance use, financial struggles and family relations."
Health and Safety,Our EAP also provides on-site emotional health support in response to a personal or work-related incident.
Health and Safety,"This is offered globally through Dow Occupational Health, and where available by local insurance or worker compensation providers."
Health and Safety,"We seek to improve the health of Dow employees by removing barriers to access and pay for appropriate, quality health care around the world."
Health and Safety,This is done through both medical insurance and other health offerings for employees.
Health and Safety,The level of support is determined based on the needs of our workforce within a given geography.
Health and Safety,"Employees across regions, businesses and functions play an active role in supporting peer well-being."
Health and Safety,"They engage in internal social media, share health and safety information, and advocate for use of company and local well-being services."
Health and Safety,Health promotion is an integral part of occupational health.
Health and Safety,It is focused on the prevention of injury and illness through education and support for healthy lifestyle change.
Health and Safety,"Our award-winning program addresses the health issues that Dow families face, on and off the job."
Health and Safety,This is accomplished by working directly with individuals and by partnering with other Dow disciplines to ensure a work environment that is supportive of healthy lifestyles.
Health and Safety,"At all Dow locations globally, workers can participate in Health and Safety teams at the facility and site level."
Health and Safety,"Attendance at safety meetings is an expectation, and select trainings and communications are provided and discussed for the workforce at large."
Health and Safety,"At the local level, employees participate in incident root cause investigations, ""fresh eyes"" assessments, internal audits and numerous other continuous improvement activities."
Health and Safety,"In most cases, these committees meet at least monthly with the primary purpose of reviewing and acting upon worker safety data and concerns, and developing implementation plans for new or improved government or company health and safety requirements."
Health and Safety,Employee feedback for continuous improvement
Health and Safety,Each standard that is part of Dow's EH&S management system has one or more standard owners who accept continuous improvement input from any employee via the EH&S organization and through a feedback tool on the Standards web page.
Health and Safety,Improvements are evaluated and prioritized.
Health and Safety,"If a global policy change is indicated, the change is presented to a global policy team for consideration and final approval."
Health and Safety,"Employees are directly and actively engaged in improving local policies, procedures and safeguards (e.g., personal protective equipment selection, unsafe conditions and near-miss programs)."
Health and Safety,Worker training on Occupational Health & Safety
Health and Safety,We provide health and safety training at no cost to workers.
Health and Safety,"Training is role-based and assigned to workers when they take on a specific role (e.g., safe work permits issuer, red tag lock-out isolator)."
Health and Safety,"In addition to formal training, informal safety training is part of every shift, every team and every meeting across Dow."
Health and Safety,"Safety moments, on-the-spot training and safety stand-downs reinforce the culture of safety and the role every employee has in supporting each other's health and safety."
Health and Safety,Taking a grassroots approach to elevating safety performance
Health and Safety,What if our team members on the frontlines led our most important safety conversations?
Health and Safety,"That was the grassroots approach we took in 2020 when launching our ""Flatten the Curve"" interactive sessions."
Health and Safety,"The virtual exchanges drew in thousands of people and contributed to a dramatic turnaround in safety performance - in effect, flattening the curve on injuries."
Health and Safety,The first session in April 2020 was attended by nearly 500 people.
Health and Safety,"In each segment, the chat function in the virtual meeting platform exploded with comments, experiences and best practices."
Health and Safety,"With an upgrade of our virtual meeting platform in 2021, these meetings accommodate 3,000 people from around the world."
Health and Safety,"After each session, a link to the recording and the transcription of the chat is sent to the nearly 4,000 people invited to the session."
Health and Safety,All employees and workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by Dow are required to comply with 100% of health and safety management system requirements.
Health and Safety,We employ a comprehensive safe work permit system that facilitates a robust dialogue around hazards and mitigation of such hazards for each task.
Health and Safety,Regular review of our health and safety management system is built in to evaluate its efficacy.
Health and Safety,"Additionally, we maintain an independent internal audit process, with accountability flowing directly to our chief executive officer, independent of the Operations organization."
Health and Safety,"The audit process ensures that every company location, regardless of purpose, is audited every three to five years."
Health and Safety,Audit frequency is determined based on the relative risk of the activities at each location.
Health and Safety,Auditors are trained and certified in each topic area that they evaluate.

Financing Environmental Impact,"Continuing our drive to reduce energy consumption even further, we want to achieve direct energy savings of 100 TJ by 2025 by executing around 25 projects in five different sites worldwide, as defined in our energy savings master plan."
Financing Environmental Impact,"We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs."
Financing Environmental Impact,"To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology."
Financing Environmental Impact,"We estimate capital expenditures in 2022 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, will be between approximately $11 billion and $12 billion."
Financing Environmental Impact,Investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows.
Financing Environmental Impact,"In addition, we invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and will yield future profitability."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition."
Financing Environmental Impact,In the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed.
Financing Environmental Impact,"As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all."
Financing Environmental Impact,"We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and may continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Our credit rating may also be affected by mu-20210902_g5.jpg 33   our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of future borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all."
Financing Environmental Impact,"There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Recently, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government, which have limited the market for our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development."
Financing Environmental Impact,"For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Any portion excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in the same line as the hedged transaction but may be recognized in a different manner, e.g. amortized."
Financing Environmental Impact,"If a hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring according to the original strategy, the hedge relationship is discontinued and the gain or loss on the associated derivative is recorded promptly in earnings."
Financing Environmental Impact,"For hedges of existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss is recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged."
Financing Environmental Impact,"As of October 31, 2021, all of Applied's subsidiaries use the United States dollar as their functional currency."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are remeasured using historical exchange rates."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Foreign currency-denominated revenues and costs are remeasured using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to the non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are remeasured using historical exchange rates."
Financing Environmental Impact,"The resulting remeasurement gains and losses are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred."
Financing Environmental Impact,Gross unrealized losses related to Applied's debt investment portfolio were not material.
Financing Environmental Impact,Applied regularly reviews its debt investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment from credit losses or other factors.
Financing Environmental Impact,Factors considered in determining whether an unrealized loss is considered to be a credit loss include the significance of the decline in value compared to the cost basis; the financial condition; credit quality and near-term prospects of the investee; and whether it is more likely than not that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to recovery.
Financing Environmental Impact,"Credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an allowance for credit losses through interest and other income, net."
Financing Environmental Impact,Any additional changes in fair value that are not related to credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Financing Environmental Impact,"During fiscal 2021, with the adoption of credit losses authoritative guidance, Applied did not recognize significant credit losses and the ending allowance for credit losses was not material."
Financing Environmental Impact,"Applied determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable fixed-income securities at October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019 were temporary in nature and therefore it did not recognize any impairment of its marketable fixed-income securities for fiscal 2020 or 2019."
Financing Environmental Impact,"During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies were not material."
Financing Environmental Impact,"These impairment charges are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations."
Financing Environmental Impact,Applied's investments consist primarily of debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at their fair values.
Financing Environmental Impact,"In determining the fair value of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing services that value securities based on quoted market prices and models that utilize observable market inputs."
Financing Environmental Impact,"In the event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers."
Financing Environmental Impact,Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine the fair value of its short-term and long-term investments.
Financing Environmental Impact,"In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities."
Financing Environmental Impact,Applied reviews any significant unanticipated differences identified through this analysis to determine the appropriate fair value.
Financing Environmental Impact,"Substantially all of Applied's available-for-sale, short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair value that was determined based upon observable inputs."
Financing Environmental Impact,Applied's equity investments with readily determinable values consist of publicly traded equity securities.
Financing Environmental Impact,These investments are measured at fair value using quoted prices for identical assets in an active market and the changes in fair value of these equity investments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
Financing Environmental Impact,Investments with remaining effective maturities of 12 months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments.
Financing Environmental Impact,Investments with remaining effective maturities of more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.
Financing Environmental Impact,Applied's equity investments without readily determinable values consist of equity investments in privately-held companies.
Financing Environmental Impact,"Applied elected the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes on a prospective basis for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values and is required to account for any subsequent observable changes in fair value within the statements of operations."
Financing Environmental Impact,These investments are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy and periodically assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that a decline in value may have occurred.

Product Carbon Footprint,We're making products with more recycled materials and working to reduce the amount of energy our devices use.
Product Carbon Footprint,"In 2020, we took a more granular look at our climate target baseline to ensure integrity of the data we track."
Product Carbon Footprint,The previous footprint was based on assumptions reaching as far back as 2012.
Product Carbon Footprint,"We had hoped to incorporate primary data from suppliers in 2020, but this continues to prove challenging."
Product Carbon Footprint,"While we have successfully engaged a majority of our key suppliers on significant energy and water reduction efforts, our careful reviews have revealed the overall quality and completeness of data disclosed to the centralized systems on which we rely to be highly inconsistent."
Product Carbon Footprint,This makes it difficult to track progress and creates a need for further review and verification of data entries.
Product Carbon Footprint,"While we continue working on a solution, we have used estimates based on highly localized lifecycle analyses."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Over time, we will incorporate our suppliers' data so we can track their progress as part of our footprint — instead of separately, which is what we do now."
Product Carbon Footprint,"The recalculated baseline is 4.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e), down from 5.2 million mtCO2e, which we previously disclosed."
Product Carbon Footprint,Emissions from our owned-and-operated activities generally fall into the Scope 1 and 2 emissions categories.
Product Carbon Footprint,"Collectively, these emissions make up less than 1% of our carbon footprint."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In 2020, we achieved a 57% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from the 2016 baseline, keeping us on track toward our goal of a 90% reduction by 2025."

Product Carbon Footprint,"By 2025, it will all come from renewable sources."
Product Carbon Footprint,"A smaller portion of our energy (17%) is from natural gas, which we plan to reduce through efficiency improvements and purchased biogas credits."
Product Carbon Footprint,Product shipping accounts for less than 10% of emissions in our global value chain.
Product Carbon Footprint,"For instance, within Europe, shipping by rail instead of air significantly lowers our emissions because air freight is 24 times more carbon intensive (per metric/kilometer) than rail."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In Asia, we use barge transport along rivers where possible, which offers lower emissions than trucking."
Product Carbon Footprint,"And in the U.S., truck transportation is being replaced by rail from port to inland distribution centers, with the intention to increase intermodal rail connections in the coming years."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Maersk, our largest global shipping partner, has an ECO Delivery program that uses waste-based biofuels to move large containers with net zero CO2 emissions."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In 2020, we shipped 500 containers through ECO Delivery, a number that will increase to 1,000 containers in 2021."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Likewise, LS&Co. has been a member of the Clean Cargo Working Group since 2018."

Product Carbon Footprint,Two proprietary tools help us proactively work with our customers toward our goal to support sustainable supply chains: our Carbon Diet service and CLEAN TransportTM carbon calculator.
Product Carbon Footprint,Our dedicated Engineering Solutions Team uses these tools to help customers optimize their shipping strategy.
Product Carbon Footprint,The basics of this five-step process are outlined below:
Product Carbon Footprint,This tool is used to calculate the carbon footprint of customer shipments and to make decisions in coordination with our customers that help to reduce their carbon footprint.
Product Carbon Footprint,"For example, the CLEAN Transport carbon calculator can estimate how much carbon reduction would be achieved by converting an over-the-road (OTR) shipment to an intermodal shipment based on a customer's historical shipping data."
Product Carbon Footprint,One such success story is Tyson Foods.
Product Carbon Footprint,"A long-time customer, in 2020, Tyson Foods used our CLEAN Transport carbon calculator to make the case to transition some of its shipments from OTR to TCI."
Product Carbon Footprint,"The company made the change and converted approximately 50 shipments per week to TCI, generating an annualized emissions savings of more than 1,104 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO2e) compared to traditional OTR shipment."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Our dedicated Engineering Solutions Team uses these tools to help customers minimize total miles, maximize payload, and reduce carbon emissions."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Over half of our footprint lies within the physical production of our Netflix-branded content (""productions""), followed by our corporate operations and purchased goods (""corporate""), followed by our data center providers (""streaming"")."
Product Carbon Footprint,"All GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol (Annex A) relevant to Netflix are accounted for and converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e) as specified by the GHG Protocol (GHG Protocol, 2004)10."
Product Carbon Footprint,"To improve our GHG data management, we have implemented a process to collect any business activity data and continue to improve on these methods."
Product Carbon Footprint,"There are certain categories of documents that are to be retained by specific groups within Netflix, following our Practices and Policies."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Our footprint includes all Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions) as well as relevant11 Scope 3 categories, which therefore includes activities outside of our operational control."
Product Carbon Footprint,"This means that we include all Netflix-branded content production, whether we manage the production directly (like Don't Look Up), or through a third-party production company (like Holiday in the Wild, Our Planet, Bill Nye Saves the World, or You vs. Wild) as well as all content that we license that is Netflix-branded (like The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, My Octopus Teacher, or Breaking Boundaries)."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Activities outside of our operational control present challenges to measuring and reducing emissions, but we believe including the emissions from Netflix-branded content (wherever it is produced) will create a positive ripple effect across the industry."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Engaging these groups requires a significant investment in collaboration across our value chain that can be resourceintensive, but we think this ultimately strengthens Netflix's business network."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Since 2011, we have been conducting a GHG inventory program per the GHG Protocol and in line with the Group's consolidated financial reporting boundaries."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In 2020, we will continue to implement and update the procedures according to ISO 14064-1:2018, and continue to commission third-party assurance pursuant to the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration's standards to conduct global external accreditation for the more significant emission items and emissions identified in the direct and indirect categories, i.e., Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In 2020, we found that the Acer Group was responsible for 3,004.03 tonnes of Scope 1 and 9,195.348 tonnes of Scope 2 (market-based) carbon emissions."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Our Scope1 and scope 2 emissions totaled 12,199.383 tonnes (market-based), with Scope 1 emissions primarily from North American and European natural gas usage and global combustion activity, and Scope 2 electricity usage accounting for approximately 75% of the combined emissions of the two."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In addition, in accordance with GHG Protocol Scope 3 principles, we carry out inventory of emissions produced by staff business flights, product and service purchases, product shipping, leased assets, product energy consumption, waste products, and power & fuel."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In addition, per GHG Protocol Scope 3 principles, we undertake an inventory of items including staff business flights; product and service procurement; product shipping, energy consumption, and end-of-life; operational waste; electricity and fuel; and leased assets."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Among these, product energy consumption creates the most significant amount of emissions, with our four main hardware categories (notebooks, desktops, all-in-ones, and displays) accounting for a total of approximately 1.08 billion kWh of power consumption in 2019. Through more thorough Scope 3 inventories, we can better understand how to control carbon risks and opportunities in the value chain, which will further help with reduction strategies."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In 2015, we took the lead in joining the Carbon Footprint Calculation Platform established by the Taiwanese EPA."
Product Carbon Footprint,"With the cooperation of our major suppliers, we have set out a plan to broaden the carbon footprint inventory across indicator products, completing a carbon footprint report for the Chromebook C740."
Product Carbon Footprint,"This cloud-based platform can effectively integrate many parties in the supply chain, providing timely calculation services and greatly reducing operating expenses, as well as accelerating inventory work."
Product Carbon Footprint,"This effort focuses on the office mode of the model, and the results have shown that carbon emissions across the product' lifecycle total approximately 123.70 kg."
Product Carbon Footprint,"The raw materials and the using phases account for greater proportions of that figure, specifically 64.50% and 33.97% of total emissions respectively."
Product Carbon Footprint,"The lightweight, quick-booting, quick-connecting nature of the product and the more streamlined components used therein (in comparison with ordinary notebooks) may help reduce the emissions at the raw materials and user ends."
Product Carbon Footprint,"To meet the requirements of the EPEAT standard and make our products more competitive in commercial bidding, since 2019, we have also enacted quantitative life cycle assessment for products."
Product Carbon Footprint,The first product for which this was completed was the Desktop PC VX4660G (or Veriton X4660G).
Product Carbon Footprint,"In cooperation with the Industrial Technology Research Institute, we carried out a full cradle-to-grave life cycle inventory and analysis of this product in line with ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006 standards."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Research results have shown that in terms of both life cycle analysis and product carbon footprint analysis, the two stages with the most significant impact are ""raw materials acquisition & component manufacturing"" and ""product use."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In 2020, Acer will officially implement the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures issued by the Financial Stability Board of the United Nations to analyze the current status of climate-change-related financial disclosures, identify and quantify climate risks, and publicly disclose the potential financial impact of climate change on Acer and its future response strategies."
Product Carbon Footprint,Financial figures pertaining to the impact of climate change are still undergoing verification.
Product Carbon Footprint,"In this section, divided into Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Indicators and Goals, we will address the core elements of the TCFD Recommendations."
Product Carbon Footprint,"The Corporate Sustainability Committee (CSC) is the top steering unit for managing and monitoring issues related to climate change, integrating strategic thinking on corporate social responsibility, and improving Acer's sustainability performance."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In addition to inviting first-level directors of business and functional units, including operation management, information products, HR, legal affairs, and finance, the committee is headed by the Chairman and CEO."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Beneath the committee are six main working groups: Corporate Governance, Risk Management, Innovation and Product Life Cycle Management, Environmental Policy and Management, Responsible Supply Chain Management, and Green Electricity."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Each of these is responsible for the everyday management of matters related to climate change, tracking performance and convening quarterly meetings to ensure everyone is on top of relevant issues."
Product Carbon Footprint,"On the implementation front, the Working Group on Risk Management has been assigned responsibility for implementing the TCFD Climate Risk Assessment Framework."
Product Carbon Footprint,"This working group's membership spans the Legal,Finance, Human Resource, Supply Chain Management, Enterprise Communication, Marketing, QA & Services, IT, Environmental Safety and Health, and Asset Management Departments, all Product Business Groups, and the ESG Office."
Product Carbon Footprint,"To integrate climate change risks into the existing risk management mechanism, Acer will in 2020 establish a climate change risk management process, conduct a comprehensive assessment of potential climate change risks through the Working Group on Risk Management, and develop appropriate countermeasures for the potential climate risks identified."
Product Carbon Footprint,"After compiling the results of climate risk identification, quantification of the impact of high climate risk factors, risk response and mitigation measures, and other relevant information, the results and response measures are presented to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Company's senior management at regular meetings of the Corporate Sustainability Committee."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In the Board's Audit Committee meetings, issues related to climate change and water resource management are also discussed to ensure a firm grasp on the climate risk environment faced by the Company and to disclose it to the relevant stakeholders in the annual CSR report."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Driven by the impacts of climate change, businesses worldwide are transitioning to greener business models and low-carbon economies."
Product Carbon Footprint,"As a leading brand in the ICT industry, Acer has sales and operating locations worldwide, so responding to climate change is an resolute responsibility for us and presents both risks and opportunities."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In addition to continuously incorporating the potential impacts of climate change into the overall operational considerations through the Risk Management Group under the Corporate Sustainability Committee, we assess the probability of risks occurring and their potential impacts, formulating risk response and mitigation plans and a crisis management mechanism."
Product Carbon Footprint,"With regard to opportunities that come with climate change, Acer also continues to pursue improvements to product energy efficiency and strive to integrate our existing and new business groups to create unified low carbon, sustainable smart strategies."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In addition, in our primary operating locations such as Aspire Park we have set up solar power generation stations."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Our Dutch subsidiary has also set up its own solar power facilities, further boosting the percentage of power coming from renewable sources."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In terms of in-house operations, in the face of Taiwanese and international regulations on the control of greenhouse gas emissions, we have not only reviewed our own operations, supply chain, and products and services, but also the possible risks of carbon emissions, formulating carbon reduction goals and strategies for the Group."
Product Carbon Footprint,"While Acer as a brand has no manufacturing facilities around the world, the Group continues to pay attention to issues such as electricity consumption, water use, and waste management and works to reduce environmental impact as much as possible through various management measures."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Furthermore, all staff are required to understand their roles and responsibilities and to communicate and cooperate with relevant partners and suppliers on an ongoing basis in order to meet our environmental commitments."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In terms of business planning, Acer thinks in terms of product life cycle management, taking into consideration the design and manufacturing, transportation, use, and recycling stages to minimize the impact of products on the environment."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Through this, the Company actively seeks a balance between product management and environmental protection, working to provide products that are more environmentally and commercially competitive."
Product Carbon Footprint,"We will continue to expand the application of product life cycle considerations and evaluate appropriate solutions to reduce carbon emissions and environmental impacts at each stage, such as expanding the introduction of post-consumer recycled plastics (PCR) to reduce dependence on and use of virgin plastics."
Product Carbon Footprint,"To improve the mechanisms for the management of risks and opportunities related to climate change, Acer has established climate-related risk management procedures in accordance with the TCFD guidelines."
Product Carbon Footprint,"The management process consists of four steps: (1) completing a climate risk inventory, (2) ordering by risk materiality, (3) results and reporting, and (4) response strategies and external disclosure."
Product Carbon Footprint,"For climate-change-related scenarios, Acer has identified short-, medium-, and long-term climate change risks by referring to relevant climate change information, TCFD disclosure recommendations, and reports and information released by other domestic and international organizations, as well as considering the characteristics of our own business, in order to list out relevant climate risk factors."
Product Carbon Footprint,The Working Group on Risk Management then invites each business unit to use a matrix to assess the potential impact and influence of climate-related transition and physical risks on the business unit's operations based on the principle of materiality.
Product Carbon Footprint,"We use a 10-year time scale to evaluate and rank the risk matrix in terms of risk impact level, potential risk vulnerability, and risk likelihood, providing regular review and feedback on the results to develop corresponding measures."
Product Carbon Footprint,"The two high-risk factors identified by Acer in the 2020 climate risk matrix are both physical risks, namely an increase in extreme weather events—heavy rainfall and an increase in average temperature."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Among the ten medium risks identified, there are seven transition risks, including increased sustainability-related demand and regulations, increased costs of greenhouse gas emissions, increased costs of raw materials, costs of low-carbon technology transition, increased negative stakeholder feedback, failed investments in new technologies, and low-carbon alternatives to existing products and services, as well as five physical risks, including increased extreme weather events—heavy rainfall, increased extreme weather events—typhoons, increased extreme weather events—extreme low temperatures, increased average temperature, and sea-level rise."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Acer has evaluated the potential impact on operations and financial planning of the two high risks identified to facilitate enhanced risk mitigation, along with the ten medium risks that can be managed by monitoring and confirming resiliency provisions."
Product Carbon Footprint,"With the passage of laws and regulations relating to carbon emissions, fees will be levied if greenhouse gas missions exceed allowances."
Product Carbon Footprint,"With emission allowance controls potentially increasing year by year, related fines may significantly increase operating costs."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In addition, there are significant costs associated with carbon emission reduction."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Actively develop low-carbon operation methods or related services (e.g., paperless services, smart energy-saving devices)."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Actively improve energy efficiency, optimize resource management processes, diversify energy sources, and improve energy stability."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Should Taiwan establish and implement regulations around sustainability and renewable energy development, Acer will need to invest more in constructing renewable energy devices and purchasing Renewable Energy ertificates (RECs)."
Product Carbon Footprint,Purchase RECs and support the development and increased usage of renewable energy sources.
Product Carbon Footprint,"Changes in the cost of raw materials needed in the production process (e.g., rare metals or packaging aterials) caused by climate change create a risk of increased production costs:"
Product Carbon Footprint,"When suppliers' raw material costs increase, contracted amounts with Acer will also increase, resulting in higher production costs and affecting profitability."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Product prices rise, possibly leading to impacts on revenues."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Identify high-climate-risk suppliers, urge them to improve their responsiveness to those risks, and promote the formation of a sustainable value chain."
Product Carbon Footprint,"To reduce the carbon emissions resulting from Acer's own operations or respond to demand for low-carbon products/services, expenditures need to move toward low-carbon transition, such as increasing investment into R7d of highly energy-efficient equipment."
Product Carbon Footprint,Actively seek out new business opportunities related to low-carbon technologies and participate in more cooperative projects on new forms of technology.
Product Carbon Footprint,"As more low-carbon products, services, and technologies appear and replace their existing Acer equivalents, this may significantly impact the Company's revenues."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Respond to the trend as early as possible, bringing forward the development and market launch of low-carbon products, services, and technologies; additionally, invest in R&D for technologies behind new low-carbon products and services to boost operating diversity."
Product Carbon Footprint,"If Acer invests in new technologies (such as IoT and AI) that have high carbon emissions and are replaced by other low-carbon technologies, or if partners switch to low-carbon technologies, this could result in the failure of the original investment in new technologies and in Acer suffering financial losses."
Product Carbon Footprint,Bring the issue of climate change into the current context of R&D into new technologies and promote the early adoption of new technologies internally to further identify new market opportunities and develop new types of services and products.
Product Carbon Footprint,"If Acer is unable to successfully implement climate change mitigation measures and thus generate negative eedback from government, investors, and customers, the Company will lose its current position as a market leader in sustainability, resulting in damage to its reputation and potential financial losses."
Product Carbon Footprint,An increase in the occurrence of heavy rainfall and the amount of that rainfall may result in:
Product Carbon Footprint,"Acer's office buildings and cloud server rooms potentially flooding, resulting in significant asset losses and subsequent recovery costs."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Acer's supply chain potentially being unable able to supply products as scheduled due to the loss of its own equipment as a result of extreme heavy rainfall, resulting in supply chain disruptions."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Damage to Acer's warehouse inventory, resulting in asset loss."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Conduct risk assessment for operating and storage locations and suppliers located in areas at high risk of flooding or susceptible to typhoons, and reduce the potential impact of disasters through prudent insurance planning and distributed procurement strategies."
Product Carbon Footprint,The increasing frequency and severity of typhoons may have the following impacts on Acer:
Product Carbon Footprint,"Our own operating sites and data centers may be exposed to strong winds, causing damage to equipment and resulting in increased asset losses and maintenance expenses."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Typhoons may disrupt Acer's supply chain, resulting in disruptions in the delivery of products and services or a decline in quality."
Product Carbon Footprint,"As the low-pressure zone from the Arctic sends cold air into the middle latitudes, this causes a rapid drop in temperature and can even lead to blizzards and other such weather conditions."
Product Carbon Footprint,"When the temperature does drop sharply or blizzards strike, this can cause:"
Product Carbon Footprint,"Monitor supplier locations, warehousing locations, and logistics routes that may be subject to extreme low temperatures to facilitate preparation and rapid response in the event of rapid temperature drops."
Product Carbon Footprint,The increase in the length of the dry season and the duration of extreme high temperatures in East Asia due to global climate change will have the following impacts on Acer:
Product Carbon Footprint,Higher electricity costs incurred in maintaining indoor temperatures at office locations.
Product Carbon Footprint,"More frequent use of air-conditioning equipment in cloud server rooms, consuming more power and leading to higher operating costs."
Product Carbon Footprint,Actively formulate energy-saving plans and evaluate the purchase of energy-saving equipment to gradually reduce non-essential energy consumption and improve energy efficiency in the course of operations.
Product Carbon Footprint,"Sea level rise may lead to the flooding of Acer's own operating sites or those of its suppliers, leading to financial losses."
Product Carbon Footprint,"For locations that may be at risk of sea-level rise, adjust the storage location of inventory according to the risk level or move the entire location."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In the future, the risk of sea-level rise will be taken into account when selecting operating or warehousing locations to minimize the possibility of flooding."
Product Carbon Footprint,Acer has also conducted an in-depth climate scenario analysis for the two identified high risks to enable management to understand the potential financial impact of climate risk on the Company and accurately measure the resources invested and their allocation when undertaking risk mitigation actions.
Product Carbon Footprint,"To address the potential financial impact of the ""Increased Extreme Weather Events—Heavy Rainfall"" risk item, Acer used the Water Risk Filter, a water risk mapping tool developed by the World Wide Fund for Nature, to assess how often cloud-based equipment and storage in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Europe would be affected by major flooding events with a future temperature rise of 2°C."
Product Carbon Footprint,We also calculated the potential loss of assets due to increased heavy rainfall by taking into account the probability of different flooding scenarios and the rate of asset loss under each.
Product Carbon Footprint,"Under the 2°C scenario, the cloud server room in Taiwan and the warehousing in the Netherlands are less likely to be affected by the risk of flooding, while the other seven Acer warehousing locations in the flood risk area will likely face varying degrees of asset loss and financial impact from 2020 to 2025."
Product Carbon Footprint,"For those warehousing locations that may be at risk from heavy rainfall, Acer will regularly review the adequacy of existing insurance arrangements (e.g., global property/cargo policies) to ensure that possible risks have been properly transferred, and will continue to strengthen relevant loss prevention measures to minimize the financial impact of extreme rainfall."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Acer used the Taiwan Climate Change Protection Information and Adaptation Knowledge Platform developed by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) to assess the financial impact of rising average temperatures and the resultant increase in power consumption and subsequent higher direct operating costs, looking particularly at Acer's headquarters and cloud server room, both of which consume more electricity."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In addition, International Energy Agency (IEA) and Enerdata 2020 statistics showed that in 2019, both residential and industrial electricity prices in Taiwan were the fourth lowest in the world."
Product Carbon Footprint,"With this maximal estimation, we see that between 2021 and 2040, the main operating and cloud server room locations, namely those in New Taipei City and Taoyuan City, Taiwan, may see increased maximum temperatures and corresponding growth in electricity use, along with a considerable annual increase in electricity costs."
Product Carbon Footprint,"According to calculations, the potential financial impact of the average temperature increase under the RCP8.5 scenario is still within the risk range that Acer can bear."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In terms of our own operations, Acer's key climate indicators for tracking at present include energy, carbon emissions, water resources, waste, and renewable energy."
Product Carbon Footprint,"On the business side, Acer continues to review the environmental impact and performance of products at each stage of their life cycle by tracking the percentage of products certified as energy-saving, the percentage of post-consumer recycled plastics used in products shipped, the percentage of recycled materials used in product packaging design, and the carbon emissions of product transportation."
Product Carbon Footprint,"Construct or entitle at least 12,000 residential units by 2025, as part of our effort to create quality mixed-use live-work-play environments."

Product Carbon Footprint,"This report marks our first disclosure on progress against our fourth generation of operational footprint goals, which we announced in 2020 and aim to achieve by 2025."
Product Carbon Footprint,"These goals are aligned with a pathway to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C and cover GHG emissions, energy use, water consumption, waste reduction and diversion, and sustainable building design"
Product Carbon Footprint,"Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our facilities were not used at full capacity in 2021, and our related resource consumption, waste generation and GHG emissions were lower than they otherwise would have been."
Product Carbon Footprint,We recognize that in some cases these impacts were simply moved to employees' homes and other non-Citi facilities.
Product Carbon Footprint,"As a result of having fewer people using Citi buildings, our progress for 2021 indicates that we exceeded some of our goals during the year."
Product Carbon Footprint,"That trend could briefly reverse in the coming years as our employees continue to return to the office, before progressing again toward meeting our goals."
Product Carbon Footprint,This is the first year we are reporting progress against our 2025 goals.
Product Carbon Footprint,We expect our progress to fluctuate as the number of people occupying our facilities varies during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Product Carbon Footprint,"In connection with our renewable electricity commitment, Citi is a member of RE100 — a global initiative led by the Climate Group and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which are both part of the We Mean Business Coalition."
Product Carbon Footprint,"In recognition of RE100's requirements, we strive as much as possible to source 100% renewable electricity within the same market boundaries as our consumption."
